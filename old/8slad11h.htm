<h2>Sticks and Stones</h2>

<p>It happened in Barrel Alley, and it was Tom Slade,
as usual, who did it. Picking a barrel-stave out of
the mud, he sidled up to Ching Wo&#8217;s laundry,
opened the door, beat the counter with a resounding
clamor, called, &#8220;Ching, Ching, Chinaman!&#8221;
and by way of a grand climax, hurled the dirty barrel-stave
at a pile of spotless starched shirts, banged the
door shut and ran.</p>

<p>Tom was &#8220;on the hook&#8221; this morning. In
one particular (and in only one) Tom was like &#8220;Old
John Temple,&#8221; who owned the bank as well as Barrel
Alley. Both took one day off a week. &#8220;Old John&#8221;
never went down to the bank on Saturdays and Tom never
went to school on Mondays. He began his school week
on Tuesday; and the truant officer was just about as
sure to cast his dreaded net in Barrel Alley on a
Monday as old John Temple was sure to visit it on
the first of the month&#8212;&#173;when the rents were
due.</p>

<p>This first and imminent rock of peril passed, Tom
lost no time in offering the opening number of his
customary morning program, which was to play some
prank on Ching Wo. But Ching Wo, often disturbed, like
a true philosopher, and knowing it was Monday, picked
out the soiled shirts, piled up the others, threw
the muddy stave out and quietly resumed his ironing.</p>

<p>Up at the corner Tom emerged around John Temple&#8217;s
big granite bank building into the brighter spectacle
of Main Street. Here he paused to adjust the single
strand of suspender which he wore. The other half of
this suspender belonged to his father; the two strands
had originally formed a single pair and now, in their
separate responsibilities, each did duty continuously,
since neither Tom nor his father undressed when they
went to bed.</p>

<p>His single strand of suspender replaced, Tom shuffled
along down Main Street on his path of glory.</p>

<p>At the next corner was a coal-box. This he opened
and helped himself to several chunks of coal. A little
farther on he came to a trolley car standing still.
Sidling up behind it, he grabbed the pole-rope, detaching
the pulley from the wire.</p>

<p>The conductor emerged, shook his fist at the retreating
boy and sent a few expletives after him. Tom then
let fly one piece of coal after another at the rear
platform of the car, keeping a single chunk for future
use.</p>

<p>For, whenever Tom Slade got into a dispute (which
was on an average of a dozen times a day), he invariably
picked up a stone. Not that he expected always to
throw it, though he often did, but because it illustrated
his attitude of suspicion and menace toward the world
in general, and toward other boys in particular.</p>

<p>So firmly rooted had the habit become that even indoors
when his father threatened him (which was likewise
on an average of a dozen times a day) he would reach
cautiously down behind his legs, as if he expected
to find a stone on the kitchen floor conveniently near
at hand.</p>

<p>First and last, Tom had heard a good deal of unfavorable
comment about his fancy for throwing stones. Mrs.
Bennett, the settlement worker, had informed him that
throwing stones was despicable, which went in one ear
and out the other, because Tom did not know what &#8220;despicable&#8221;
meant. The priest had told him that it was both wicked
and cowardly; while the police had gone straight to
the heart of the matter by threatening to lock him
up for it.</p>

<p>And yet, you know, it was not until Tom met young
Mr. Ellsworth, scoutmaster, that he heard something
on the subject which stuck in his mind. On this day
of Tom&#8217;s wild exploits, as he moved along a little
further down the street he came to the fence which
enclosed John Temple&#8217;s vacant lot. It was covered
with gaudy posters and with his remaining piece of
coal he proceeded to embellish these.</p>

<p>He was so absorbed in his decorative enterprise that
he did not notice the person who was standing quietly
on the sidewalk watching him, until he was aware of
a voice speaking very sociably.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I should do that, my boy,
if I were you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom paused (in the middle of a most unwholesome sentence)
and saw a young gentleman, perhaps twenty-seven or
twenty-eight years old, looking pleasantly at him.
He was extremely well-dressed in a natty blue serge
suit, and to Tom his appearance was little less than
gorgeous.</p>

<p>The boy&#8217;s first impulse was, of course, to run,
and he made a start as if to do so. Then, fearing
perhaps that there was not a clear get-away, he stooped
for a stone.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do with that?&#8221;
asked the young gentleman, smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nartin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You weren&#8217;t going to throw it at me,
I hope, while I am standing three feet from you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom was a little nonplussed. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t
t&#8217;row no stone standin&#8217; near yer,&#8221;
he grumbled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said the young man; &#8220;you
have some ideas about sporting, haven&#8217;t you?
Though, of course, you&#8217;re no sport&#8212;&#173;or
you wouldn&#8217;t have picked up a stone at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now this was great news to Tom. He knew he was no
gentleman; Mrs. Bennett had told him that. He knew
he was a hoodlum; the trolley conductors had told
him that. He knew that he was lazy and shiftless and
unkempt and a number of other things, for the world
at large had made no bones of telling him so; but
never, never for one moment had he supposed that he
was no sport. He had always believed that to hit a
person with a stone and &#8220;get away with it&#8221;
represented the very top-notch of fun, and sporting
proficiency.</p>

<p>So he looked at this young man as if he thought that
he had inadvertently turned the world upside down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me that piece of coal, my boy, and let&#8217;s
see if we can&#8217;t mark out that last word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yer&#8217;ll git yer hand all dirty wid coal,&#8221;
said Tom, hardly knowing what else to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, a dirty hand isn&#8217;t as bad as a
filthy word; besides, I&#8217;m rooting in the dirt
with my hands all summer, anyway,&#8221; said the young
man, as he marked out Tom&#8217;s handiwork. &#8220;There,&#8221;
he added, handing back the coal, &#8220;that&#8217;s
not so bad now; guess neither one of us is much of
an artist, hey? See that scratch?&#8221; he went on,
exhibiting his hand to Tom. &#8220;I got that shinning
up a tree. Come on, let&#8217;s beat it; first thing
you know a cop will be here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom hardly knew what to think of this strange, sumptuously-attired
creature whose hands were rooting in the dirt all summer,
and who got a scratch (which he proudly exhibited)
from shinning up a tree; who said &#8220;beat it&#8221;
when he meant &#8220;go away,&#8221; and who called
a policeman a &#8220;cop.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom rather liked the way this strange man talked,
though it was not without a tinge of suspicion that
he accompanied him along the street, casting furtive
glances at his luxurious attire, wondering how such
as he could climb a tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t shin up no tree,&#8221;
he presently ventured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, couldn&#8217;t I, though?&#8221; laughed
his companion. &#8220;I&#8217;ve shinned up more trees
than you&#8217;ve got fingers and toes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you was a kid?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a kid now, and don&#8217;t you forget
it. And I&#8217;ll give you a tip, too. Grind up some
bark in your hands&#8212;&#173;it works fine.&#8221;</p>

<p>They walked on silently for a little way; an ill-assorted
pair they must have seemed to a passer-by, the boy
hitching up his suspender as often as it slid from
his shoulder in his shuffling effort to keep up with
the alert stride of his companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Trouble with stone-throwing is that there isn&#8217;t
any skill in it. You know what Buck Edwards said,
don&#8217;t you? He said he&#8217;d have learned to
pitch much easier if it hadn&#8217;t been for throwing
stones when he was a kid. He used to be a regular
fiend at it, and when he came to passing curves he
couldn&#8217;t make his first finger behave. You think
Buck can beat that pitcher the Prep. boys have got?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dem High School guys is all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Buck&#8217;s a good pitcher. I don&#8217;t
suppose I&#8217;ve thrown a stone in ten years. But
I bet I could practice for ten minutes and beat you
out. You smoke, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;N-no&#8212;&#173;yeer, I do sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just caught the truth by the tail that time,
didn&#8217;t you?&#8221; the young man laughed. &#8220;Well,
a kid can&#8217;t aim steady if he smokes: that&#8217;s
one sure thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom was seized with a strange desire to strengthen
his companion&#8217;s side of the case. The poor boy
had few enough arguments, goodness knows, in defense
of his own habits, and his information was meagre enough.
Yet the one little thing which he seemed to remember
about the other side of stone-throwing he now contributed
willingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s bad too if you ever land a guy one
in the temple.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know; I don&#8217;t think
there&#8217;s so much in that, though there may be.
I landed a guy one in the temple with a stick last
summer&#8212;&#173;accident, of course, and I thought
it would kill him, but it didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom was surprised and fascinated by the stranger&#8217;s
frankness.</p>

<p>&#8220;But a fellow that throws stones is no sport,
that&#8217;s sure, and you can mark that up in your
brain if you happen to have a lump of coal handy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I chucked that coal&#8212;&#173;honest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good.&#8221;</p>

<p>It had been Tom&#8217;s intention to go down through
Chester Street and steal an apple from Schmitt&#8217;s
Grocery, but instead he accompanied his new friend
until that mysterious person turned to enter a house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess we didn&#8217;t swap names, did we?&#8221;
the stranger said, holding out his hand.</p>

<p>It was the first time that Tom Slade had grasped anyone&#8217;s
hand in many a day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom&#8212;&#173;Tom Slade,&#8221; he said, hitching
up his suspender.</p>

<p>&#8220;So? Mine&#8217;s Ellsworth. Come up to the
Library building and see us some Friday night&#8212;&#173;the
boys, I mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, are you the boss o&#8217; them regiment
fellers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not exactly the boss; scouts we call ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s a scout? A soldier, like?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, a scout&#8217;s a fellow that does stunts
and things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I betcher <i>you</i> kin do a few.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I bet I can!&#8221; laughed Mr. Ellsworth;
&#8220;you said it! I&#8217;ve got some of those boys
guessing.&#8221; Which was the plain truth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Drop in some Friday night and see us; don&#8217;t
forget now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom watched him as he ascended the steps of a neighboring
porch. He had a strange fascination for the boy, and
it was not till the door closed behind him that Tom&#8217;s
steady gaze was averted. Then he shuffled off down
the street.</p>
<br><br>
<h1><a name="#2">Chapter II</a></h1>

<h2>&#8220;Hats Off&#8221;</h2>

<p>Tom Slade awoke at about eleven o&#8217;clock, swung
his legs to the floor, yawned, rubbed his eyes, felt
blindly for his tattered shoes and sniffed the air.</p>

<p>Something was wrong, that was sure. Tom sniffed again.
Something had undoubtedly happened. The old familiar
odor which had dwelt in the Slade apartment all winter,
the stuffy smell of bed clothes and dirty matting,
of kerosene and smoke and fried potatoes and salt-fish
and empty beer bottles, had given place to something
new. Tom sniffed again.</p>

<p>Then, all of a sudden, his waking senses became aware
of his father seated in his usual greasy chair, sideways
to the window.</p>

<p>And the window was open!</p>

<p>The stove-lifter which had been used to pry it up
lay on the sill, and the spring air, gracious and
democratic, was pouring in amid the squalor just as
it was pouring in through the wide-swung cathedral
windows of John Temple&#8217;s home up in Grantley
Square.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yer opened the winder, didn&#8217; yer?&#8221;
said Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never you mind what I done,&#8221; replied
his father.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t it after six?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never you mind what &#8217;tis; git yer cap
&#8216;n&#8217; beat it up to Barney&#8217;s for a
pint.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t we goin&#8217; to have no eats?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, we ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; ter have no
eats. You tell Barney to give ye a cup o&#8217; coffee;
tell &#8217;im I said so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Awh, he wouldn&#8217; give me no pint widout
de money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He wouldn&#8217;, wouldn&#8217; he? I&#8217;ll
<i>pint</i> you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; ter graft on him
no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Git me a dime off Tony then and stop in Billy&#8217;s
comin&#8217; back &#8216;n&#8217; tell him I got the
cramps agin and can&#8217;t work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll gimme the laugh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give ye the other kind of a laugh
if ye don&#8217;t beat it. I left you sleep till eleven
o&#8217;clock&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217; leave me sleep,&#8221; said
Tom. &#8220;Yer only woke up yerself half an hour
ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yer call me a liar, will ye?&#8221; roared
Bill Slade, rising.</p>

<p>Tom took his usual strategic position on the opposite
side of the table, and as his father moved ominously
around it, kept the full width of it between them.
When he reached a point nearest the sink he grabbed
a dented pail therefrom and darted out and down the
stairs.</p>

<p>Up near Grantley Square was a fence which bore the
sign, &#8220;Post No Bills.&#8221; How this had managed
to escape Tom hitherto was a mystery, but he now altered
it, according to the classic hoodlum formula, so that
it read, &#8220;Post No Bills,&#8221; and headed up
through the square for Barney Galloway&#8217;s saloon.
Bill Slade had been reduced to long-distance intercourse
in the matter of saloons for he had exhausted his credit
in all the places near Barrel Alley.</p>

<p>In the spacious garden of John Temple&#8217;s home
a girl of twelve or thirteen years was bouncing a
ball. This was Mary Temple, and what business &#8220;old&#8221;
John Temple had with such a pretty and graceful little
daughter, I am not qualified to explain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chuck it out here,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;an&#8217;
I&#8217;ll ketch it in the can.&#8221;</p>

<p>She retreated a few yards into the garden, then turned,
and gave Tom a withering stare.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chuck it out here and I&#8217;ll chuck it back&#8212;&#173;honest,&#8221;
called Tom.</p>

<p>The girl&#8217;s dignity began to show signs of collapse.
She wanted to have that ball thrown, and to catch
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you promise to toss it back?&#8221; she
weakened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Word and honor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cross your heart?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still she hesitated, arm in air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you promise to throw it back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, hope to die. Chuck it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get back a little,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>The ball went sailing over the paling, Tom caught
it, gave a yell of triumph, beat a tattoo upon the
can, and ran for all he was worth.</p>

<p>Outside the saloon Tom borrowed ten cents from Tony,
the bootblack, on his father&#8217;s behalf, and with
this he purchased the beer.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the bad turn which he had done had begun
to sprout and by the time he reached home it had grown
and spread to such proportions that Jack&#8217;s beanstalk
was a mere shrub compared with it. Nothing was farther
from John Temple&#8217;s thoughts that beautiful Saturday
than to pay a visit to Barrel Alley. On the contrary,
he was just putting on his new spring hat to go out
to the Country Club for a turn at golf, when Mary
came in crying that Tom Slade had stolen her ball.</p>

<p>Temple cared nothing about the ball, nor a great deal
about Mary&#8217;s tears, but the mention of Tom Slade
reminded him that the first of the month was close
at hand and that he had intended to &#8220;warn&#8221;
Bill Slade with the usual threat of eviction. Bill
had never paid the rent in full after the second month
of his residence in Barrel Alley. When he was working
and Temple happened to come along at a propitious moment,
Bill would give him two dollars or five dollars, as
the case might be, but as to how the account actually
stood he had not the slightest idea.</p>

<p>If Tom had not sent Mary Temple into the house crying
her father would never have thought to go through
Barrel Alley on his way out to the Country Club, but
as it was, when Tom turned into the Alley from Main
Street, he saw Mr. Temple&#8217;s big limousine car
standing in front of his own door.</p>

<p>If there was one thing in this world more than another
dear to the heart of Tom Slade, it was a limousine
car. Even an Italian organgrinder did not offer the
mischievous possibilities of a limousine. He had a
regular formula for the treatment of limousines which
was as sure of success as a &#8220;cure all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Placing his pail inside the doorway, he approached
the chauffeur with a suspiciously friendly air which
boded mischief. After a strategic word or two of cordiality,
he grasped the siren horn, tooted it frantically,
pulled the timer aroundr opened one of the doors, jumped
in and out of the opposite door, leaving both open,
and retreated as far as the corner, calling, &#8220;Yah-h-h-h-h!&#8221;</p>

<p>In a few minutes he returned very cautiously, sidled
up to the house door, and took his belated way upstairs.</p>

<p>Tom placed his pail on the lower step of the stair
leading up to the floor above his own, but did not
enter the room whence emanated the stern voice of
John Temple and the lying excuses of his father. He
went down and out on the door step and sat on the
railing, gazing at the chauffeur with an exasperating
look of triumph.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217; be no lousy Cho-fure,&#8221;
he began.</p>

<p>The chauffeur (who received twenty-five dollars a
week) did not see the force of this remark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Runnin&#8217; over kids all de time-you lie,
<i>yer did too</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>The chauffeur looked straight ahead and uttered not
a word.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yer&#8217;d be in jail if &#8217;twuzn&#8217;t
fer old John paying graft ter the cops!&#8221;</p>

<p>The chauffeur, who knew his place, made never a sign.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yer stinkin&#8217; thief! Yer don&#8217;t do
a thing but cop de car fer joy-rides&#8212;&#173; didn&#8217;
yer?&#8221;</p>

<p>At this the chauffeur stirred slightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yer will!&#8221; yelled Tom, jumping down
from the railing.</p>

<p>He had just picked up a stone, when the portly form
of John Temple emerged from the door behind him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put down that stone, sir, or I&#8217;ll lock
you up!&#8221; said he with the air of one who is
accustomed to being obeyed.</p>

<p>&#8220;G-wan, he called me a liar!&#8221; shouted
Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s just what you are,&#8221;
said John Temple, &#8220;and if certain people of
this town spent less for canvas uniforms to put on
their boys to make tramps out of them, we should be
able, perhaps, to build an addition to the jail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ya-ah, an&#8217; you&#8217;d be de first one
to go into it!&#8221; Tom yelled, as Temple reached
the step of his car.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; said Temple, turning
suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s <i>what!</i>&#8221; shouted
Tom, letting fly the stone. It went straight to its
mark, removing &#8220;old&#8221; John&#8217;s spring
hat as effectually as a gust of wind, and leaving
it embedded in the mud below the car.</p>

<h2>In Jail and Out Again</h2>

<p>That night, when Tom Slade, all unaware of the tragedy
which threatened his young life, shuffled into Billy&#8217;s
garage, he announced to his followers a plan which
showed his master mind as leader of the gang. &#8220;Hey,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;I heard Sissy Bennett&#8217;s mother
say she&#8217;s goin&#8217; ter have a s&#8217;prise
party fer him Friday night, &#8216;n&#8217; d&#8217;yer
know wot I&#8217;m goin&#8217; ter do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell him and spoil it fer him?&#8221; ventured
Joe Flynn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Na-a-h!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tick-tack?&#8221; asked Slush Ryder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Na-ah, tick-tacks is out o&#8217; date,&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cord ter trip &#8217;em up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess agin, guess agin,&#8221; said Tom, exultantly.</p>

<p>But as no one ventured any further guesses, he announced
his plan forthwith.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say a word-don&#8217;t say a word,&#8221;
he ejaculated. &#8220;I swiped two o&#8217; thim quarantine
signs offen two doors, &#8216;n&#8217; I&#8217;m gon&#8217;er
tack one up on Sissy&#8217;s door Friday night! Can
yer beat it?&#8221;</p>

<p>None of them could beat it, for it was an inspiration.
To turn away Master Connover&#8217;s young guests
by this simple but effectual device was worthy of
the leadership qualities of Tom Slade. Having thus
advertised the possibilities of the signs he took
occasion to announce,</p>

<p>&#8220;I got anoder one, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll sell
it fer a dime.&#8221; But even though he marked it
down to a dime, none would buy, so he announced his
intention of raffling it off.</p>

<p>Before the momentous evening of Connover&#8217;s party
arrived, however, something else happened which had
a curious and indirect effect upon the carrying out
of Tom&#8217;s plan.</p>

<p>On Wednesday afternoon three men came down Barrel
Alley armed with a paper for Bill Slade. It was full
of &#8220;whereases&#8221; and &#8220;now, therefores&#8221;
and other things which Bill did not comprehend, but
he understood well enough the meaning of their errand.</p>

<p>The stone which Tom had thrown at John Temple had
rebounded with terrific force!</p>

<p>One man would have been enough, goodness knows, to
do the job in hand, for there were only six or seven
pieces of furniture. They got in each other&#8217;s
way a good deal and spat tobacco juice, while poor
helpless, inefficient Bill Slade stood by watching
them.</p>

<p>From various windows and doors the neighbors watched
them too, and some congratulated themselves that their
own rents were paid, while others wondered what would
become of poor Tom now.</p>

<p>This was the scene which greeted Tom as he came down
Barrel Alley from school.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wot are they doin&#8217;?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you see wot they&#8217;re a-doin&#8217;?&#8221;
roared his father. &#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t them
that&#8217;s doin&#8217; it neither, it&#8217;s <i>you&#8212;&#173;you
done it!!</i> It&#8217;s <i>you</i> took the
roof from over my head, you and old John Temple!&#8221;
Advancing menacingly, he poured forth a torrent of
abuse at his wretched son.</p>

<p>&#8220;The two o&#8217; yez done it! You wid yer rocks
and him wid his dirty marshals and judges! I&#8217;ll
get the both o&#8217; yez yet! Ye sneakin&#8217; rat!&#8221;</p>

<p>He would have struck Tom to the ground if Mrs. O&#8217;Connor,
a mournful figure in shoddy black, had not crossed
the street and forced her way between them.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas <i>you</i> done it, Bill Slade,
and not him, and don&#8217;t you lay yer hand on him&#8212;&#173;mind
that! &#8216;Twas you an&#8217; your whiskey bottle
done it, you lazy loafer, an&#8217; the street is
well rid o&#8217; you. Don&#8217;t you raise your
hand agin me, Bill Slade&#8212;&#173;I&#8217;m not afraid
o&#8217; the likes o&#8217; you. I tell you &#8217;twas
<i>you</i> sent the poor boy&#8217;s mother to
her grave&#8212;&#173;you and your whiskey bottle!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8212;&#173;I&#8212;&#173;ain&#8217;t scared
uv him!&#8221; said Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;You stay right here now and don&#8217;t be
foolish, and me an&#8217; you&#8217;ll go over an&#8217;
have a cup o&#8217; coffee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then one of the men emerged bearing in one arm
the portrait of the late Mrs. Slade and in the other
hand Bill Slade&#8217;s battered but trusty beer can.
The portrait he laid face up on the table and set the
can on it.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is expecting too much to assume that a
city marshal would have any sense of the fitness of
things, but it was an unfortunate moment to make such
a mistake. As Mrs. O&#8217;Connor lifted the pail a
dirty ring remained on the face of the portrait.</p>

<p>&#8220;D&#8217;yer see wot yer done?&#8221; shrieked
Tom, rushing at the marshal. &#8220;D&#8217;yer see
wot yer done?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no stopping him. With a stream of profanity
he rushed at the offending marshal, grabbing him by
the neck, and the man&#8217;s head shook and swayed
as if it were in the grip of a mad dog.</p>

<p>It was in vain that poor Mrs. O&#8217;Connor attempted
to intercede, catching hold of the infuriated boy
and calling,</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Tommy, for the dear Lord&#8217;s sake,
stop and listen to me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom did not even hear.</p>

<p>The marshal, his face red and his eyes staring, went
down into the mud of Barrel Alley and the savage,
merciless pounding of his face could be heard across
the way.</p>

<p>While the other marshals pulled Tom off his half-conscious
victim, the younger contingent came down the street
escorting a sauntering blue-coat, who swung his club
leisurely and seemed quite master of the situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;He kilt him, he kilt him!&#8221; called little
Sadie McCarren.</p>

<p>Tom, his scraggly hair matted, his face streaming,
his chest heaving, and his ragged clothing bespattered,
stood hoisting up his suspender, safe in the custody
of the other two marshals.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take this here young devil around to the station,&#8221;
said one of the men, &#8220;for assault and battery
and interferin&#8217; with an officer of the law in
the performance of his dooty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along, Tom,&#8221; said the policeman;
&#8220;in trouble again, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t yer leave him go just this time?&#8221;
pleaded Mrs. O&#8217;Connor. &#8220;He ain&#8217;t
himself at all&#8212;&#173;yer kin see it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take him in,&#8221; said the rising victim,
&#8220;for interferin&#8217; with an officer of the
law in the performance of dooty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s his folks?&#8221; the policeman
asked, not unkindly.</p>

<p>It was then the crowd discovered that Bill Slade had
disappeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to take you along,&#8221; said
the officer.</p>

<p>Tom said never a word. He had played his part in the
proceedings, and he was through.</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t yer leave him come over jist
till I make him a cup o&#8217; coffee?&#8221; Mrs.
O&#8217;Connor begged.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll give him his dinner at the station,
ma&#8217;am,&#8221; the policeman answered.</p>

<p>Mrs. O&#8217;Connor stood there choking as Tom was
led up the street, the full juvenile force of Barrel
Alley thronging after him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217; yer leave me pull my strap up?&#8221;
he asked the policeman.</p>

<p>The officer released his arm, taking him by the neck
instead, and the last that Mrs. O&#8217;Connor saw
Tom was hauling his one rebellious strand of suspender
up into place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor lad, I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;ll
become uv him now,&#8221; said Mrs. O&#8217;Connor,
pausing on her doorstep to speak with a neighbor.</p>

<p>&#8220;And them things over there an&#8217; night
comin&#8217; on,&#8221; said her companion. &#8220;I
wisht that alarm clock was took away&#8212;&#173;seems
as if &#8216;twas laughin&#8217; at the whole thing&#8212;&#173;like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Tain&#8217;t only his bein&#8217; arrested,&#8221;
said Mrs. O&#8217;Connor, &#8220;but ther&#8217; ain&#8217;t
no hope for him at all, as I kin see. Ther&#8217;s
no one can in<i>floo</i>ence him.&#8221;</p>

<p>In Court, the next morning, the judge ruled out all
reference to the disfigurement of Mrs. Slade&#8217;s
portrait as being &#8220;incompetent and irrelevant,&#8221;
and when the &#8220;assault and battery&#8221; could
not be made to seem &#8220;an act done in self-defense
and by reason of the imminent peril of the accused,&#8221;
Tom was taken to the &#8220;jug&#8221; to spend the
balance of the day and to ponder on the discovery
that a &#8220;guy&#8221; has no right to &#8220;slam&#8221;
a marshal just because he sets a dirty beer can on
his mother&#8217;s picture.</p>

<p>His first enterprise after his liberation was a flank
move on Schmitt&#8217;s Grocery where he stole a couple
of apples and a banana, which latter he ate going
along the street. These were his only luncheon. The
banana skin he threw on the pave-ment.</p>

<p>In a few moments he heard footsteps behind him and,
turning, saw a small boy coming along dangling the
peel he had dropped. The boy was a jaunty little fellow,
wearing a natty spring suit. It was, in fact, &#8220;Pee-wee&#8221;
Harris, Tenderfoot, who was just starting out to cover
Provision 5 of the Second Class Scout requirements,
for he was going to be a Second Class Scout before
camping-time, or know the reason why.</p>

<p>&#8220;You drop that?&#8221; he asked pleasantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye-re, you kin have it,&#8221; said Tom cynically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Pee-wee, and the banana
peel went sailing over the fence into Temple&#8217;s
lot.</p>

<p>&#8220;First thing you know somebody&#8217;d get a
free ride on that thing,&#8221; said Pee-wee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye-re?&#8221; said Tom sneeringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And if anybody got anything free near John
Temple&#8217;s property&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dere&#8217;s where yer said it, kiddo,&#8221;
said Tom, approvingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;So long,&#8221; said Pee-wee, and went gaily
on, walking a little, then running a little, then
walk-ing again, until Tom thought he must be crazy.
Happening just at that minute to finish one of his
apples (or rather one of Schmitt&#8217;s apples) he
let fly the core straight for the back of Pee-wee&#8217;s
head.</p>

<p>Then a most extraordinary thing, happened. Without
so much as turning round, Pee-wee raised his hand,
caught the core, threw it over into the lot, and then,
turning, laughed, &#8220;Thanks, good shot!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom had always supposed that the back of a person&#8217;s
head was a safe target, and he could not comprehend
the instinct which was so alert and highly-tuned that
it could work entirely independent of the eyes. But
this was merely one of Pee-wee&#8217;s specialties,
and his amazing progress from Tenderfoot to Star Scout
is a story all by itself.</p>

<p>Tom hoisted himself onto the board fence and attacked
the other apple. Just then along came &#8220;Sweet
Caporal&#8221; demanding the core.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gimme it &#8216;n&#8217; I&#8217;ll put yer
wise ter sup&#8217;m.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom made the speculation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wop Joe&#8217;s around de corner wid his pushcart?
wot d&#8217;ye say we give him de spill?&#8221;</p>

<p>They were presently joined by &#8220;Slats&#8221;
Corbett, and the &#8220;Two Aces,&#8221; Jim and Jake
Mattenberg, and shortly thereafter Wop Joe&#8217;s
little candystand was carried by assault.</p>

<p>The gum-drops and chocolate bars which did not find
their way into the pockets of the storming host, were
strewn about the street, the whistle of the peanut-roaster
was broken off and Tom went scooting down the street
tooting it vigorously.</p>

<p>This affair scattered the gang for the time, and presently
Tom and &#8220;Sweet Caporal&#8221; found themselves
together. They got an empty bottle from an ash wagon,
broke it and distributed the pieces along Broad Street,
which they selected as a sort of &#8220;mine area&#8221;
for the embarrassment of auto traffic.</p>

<p>Tom then shuffled into the Public Library, ostensibly
to read, but in fact to decorate the books according
to his own theories of art, and was ejected because
he giggled and scuffed his feet and interfered with
the readers.</p>

<p>It would not be edifying to follow Tom&#8217;s shuffling
footsteps that afternoon, nor to enumerate the catalogue
of unseemly phrase and vicious mischief which filled
the balance of the day. He wound up his career of
glory by one of the most contemptible things which
he had ever done. He went up at dusk and tacked his
quarantine sign to the outer gate of the Bennett place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee, I hope they&#8217;re all home,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>They <i>were</i> all at home and Mrs. Bennett,
whom he hated, was busy with preparation and happy
anticipations for her unsuspecting son. That the wretched
plan did not succeed was due to no preparatory omission
on the part of Tom, but because something happened
which changed the whole face of things.</p>

<br><br>
<h1><a name="#4">Chapter IV</a></h1>

<h2>Camp Solitaire</h2>

<p>Tom&#8217;s visit to the Library reminded him that
it was here &#8220;them regiment fellers&#8221; met,
and since it was near the Bennett place he decided
to loiter thereabout, partly for the ineffable pleasure
of beholding the side-tracking of Connover&#8217;s
party, and partly in the hope of seeing Mr. Ellsworth
again.</p>

<p>So he shuffled around a little before dark and did
sentinel duty between the two places. He wanted something
to eat very much indeed, and he surmised that such
a sympathetic fellow as young Mr. Ellsworth would
&#8220;give him the lend of a nickel&#8221; especially
if he were tipped off in regard to the coming ball
game.</p>

<p>Standing outside, Tom heard the uproarious laughter
through the basement windows and wondered what it
was all about. Strange that fellows could be enjoying
themselves so thoroughly who were not up to some kind
of mischief.</p>

<p>Presently, the basement door opened and the scouts
began to come out. Tom loitered in the shadow across
the way.</p>

<p>The first group paused on the sidewalk bent on finishing
their discussion as to whether &#8220;whipping&#8221;
was as good as splicing for two strands of rope. One
boy insisted that splicing was the only way if you
knew how to do it, but that you had to whittle a splicing
needle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t trust <i>my</i> weight
on any double whipping,&#8221; said another fellow.
&#8220;The binding wouldn&#8217;t stand salt water&#8212;&#173;not
unless you tarred it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If <i>my</i> little snow-white hand is
going to grab that loop, it&#8217;ll be spliced,&#8221;
said the first speaker.</p>

<p>Another boy came out and said <i>he</i> could
jump the gap without any rope at all; it was only
seven feet, and what was the use of a rope anyway?
Then someone said that Pee-wee would do it scout pace,
and there was a great laugh. The group went on up
the street.</p>

<p>Then out came the renowned Pee-wee himself in hot
pursuit of them, running a little, walking a little,
according to his habit.</p>

<p>Two more boys came out and one of them said it was
going to rain to-morrow. Tom wondered how he knew.
Then three or four of the Ravens appeared and one
said it would be a great stunt if they could work that
on the Silver Foxes at midnight.</p>

<p>Tom didn&#8217;t know what the Silver Foxes were (he
knew there were no foxes in Bridgeboro), and he had
no notion what &#8220;that&#8221; meant, but he liked
the idea of doing it at midnight. He would like to
be mixed up in something which was done at midnight
himself.</p>

<p>But his trusty pal, Mr. Ellsworth, did not appear.
Whether he was absent that evening, Tom never knew.
The last ones to emerge from the Library basement,
were a couple of boys who were talking about dots and
dashes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You want to make your dot flares shorter,&#8221;
one said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I tell you what I&#8217;m going to say?&#8221;
the other asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sure not, let me dope it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, get on the job as soon as you reach
home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, then I won&#8217;t say good-night
till later. So long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See you to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>How these two expected to say good night without seeing
each other Tom could not imagine, but he thought it
had something to do with &#8220;dot flares&#8221;;
in any event, it was something very mysterious and
was to be done that night. He rather liked the idea
of it.</p>

<p>The two boys separated, one going up toward Blakeley&#8217;s
Hill and pausing to glance at the quarantine sign
on the Bennett house as he passed. Tom was rather
surprised that he noticed it since he seemed to be
in a hurry, but he followed, resolved to &#8220;slam&#8221;
the fellow if he took it down.</p>

<p>Then there came into his head the bright idea that
if he followed this boy up the hill to an unfrequented
spot he could hold him up for a nickel.</p>

<p>A little way up the hill the boy suddenly turned and
stood waiting for him. Tom was hardly less than amazed
at this for he had thought that his pursuit was not
known. When they came face to face Tom saw that it
was none other than the &#8220;half-baked galook&#8221;
Roy Blakeley.</p>

<p>He wore the full Scout regalia which fitted him to
perfection, and upon his left breast Tom could see
a ribbon with something bright depending from it,
which seemed to be in the shape of a bird. He had a
trim figure and stood very straight, and about his
neck was a looselyknotted scarf of a silvery gray
color, showing quite an expanse of bare throat. His
sleeves were rolled up to his elbows, and on one wrist
he wore a leather band.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you following me for?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s follerin&#8217; yer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t follerin&#8217; yer neither.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yer mean ter tell me I&#8217;m lyin&#8217;?&#8221;
shouted Tom, advancing with a threatening air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom&#8217;s hulking form was within a few inches&#8217;
of Blakeley and he thrust forward his lowered head
and held his clenched fist conveniently ready at his
side, but Roy did not budge. On the contrary, he seemed
rather amused. He did not scare worth a cent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yer want me ter hand ye one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sure not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well then, was I lyin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surest thing you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gimme a nickel &#8216;n&#8217; I&#8217;ll leave
ye off,&#8221; said Tom magnanimously.</p>

<p>The boy laughed and asked, &#8220;What do you want
the nickel for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fer a cup o&#8217; coffee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roy paused a minute, biting his lip ruminatively,
frankly contemplating him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can make you a better cup of coffee,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;than any lunch wagon juggler in this
town. You&#8217;re halfway up the hill now; come on
up the rest of the way&#8212;&#173;just for a stunt.
Ever up on the hill?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, you&#8217;re not in a hurry to get
home, are you? I&#8217;ll give you some plum-duff
I made and you can have a belt axe to chop it with
if you want to. Come on, just for a stunt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s up dere?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just &#8216;Yours sincerely.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yer live in de big house, don&#8217;cher?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not fer me; guess again. Nay, nay, my boy,
<i>I</i> live in Camp Solitaire, with a ring
round it. Anybody steps inside that ring gets his
wrist slapped and two demerits. I let the house stay
there on account of my mother and father and the cat.
Don&#8217;t you worry, you won&#8217;t get within
two hundred feet of the house. The house and I don&#8217;t
speak.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom, half suspicious but wanting a cup of coffee,
shuffled along at Roy&#8217;s side. The scout&#8217;s
offhand manner and rather whimsical way of talking
took the wind out of his belligerence, and he allowed
himself so far to soften toward this &#8220;rich guy&#8221;
as to say,</p>

<p>&#8220;Me an&#8217; our house don&#8217;t speak neither;
we wuz chucked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Chucked?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye-re, put out. Old John Temple done it, but
I&#8217;m hunk all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When was that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Couple o&#8217; days ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>He told the story of the eviction and his companion
listened as they plodded up the hill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Roy, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t
slept indoors for two weeks, and I&#8217;m not going
to for the next six weeks. And the best way to get
hunk on a fellow that puts you out of a house is just
to sleep outdoors. They can&#8217;t put you out of
there very well. Camp, and you&#8217;ve got the laugh
on them!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee, I thought nobuddy but poor guys slep&#8217;
outdoors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the poor guys that sleep <i>indoors,</i>&#8221;
said Roy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217; de wind git on ye?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure&#8212;&#173;gets all over you; it&#8217;s
fine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My father give <i>me</i> a raw hand-out,
all right, and then some more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s no use fighting your pack.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yer what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your pack&#8212;&#173;as Dan Beard says.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s he&#8212;&#173;one o&#8217; your
crowd?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet he is. &#8216;Fighting your pack&#8217;
is scrapping with your job&#8212;&#173;with what can&#8217;t
be helped&#8212;&#173;kind of. See?&#8221;</p>

<p>They walked along in silence, Tom&#8217;s half-limping
sideways gait in strange contrast with his companion&#8217;s
carriage, and soon entered the spacious grounds of
the big old-fashioned house which crowned the summit
of Blakeley&#8217;s Hill, one of the show places of
the town.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you jump that hedge?&#8221; said Roy, as
he leaped over it. &#8220;This&#8217;ll be your first
sleep outdoors, won&#8217;t it? If you wake up all
of a sudden and hear a kind of growling don&#8217;t
get scared&#8212;&#173;it&#8217;s only the trees.&#8221;</p>

<p>Under a spacious elm, a couple of hundred feet from
the house, was a little tent with a flag-pole near
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s where Old Glory hangs out, but
she goes to bed at sunset. That&#8217;s what gives
her such rosy cheeks. We&#8217;ll hoist her up and
give her the salute in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Near the tent was a small fire place of stones, with
a rough bench by it and a chair fashioned from a grocery
box. Before the entrance stood two poles and on a
rough board across these were painted the words, CAMP
SOLITAIRE, as Tom saw by the light of the lantern which
Roy held up for a moment.</p>

<p>The tent was furnished with a cot, blankets, mosquito-netting,
several books on a little shelf, and magazines strewn
about with BOYS&#8217; LIFE on their covers. On the
central upright was a little shelf with a reflector
for the lantern, and close to the pole a rickety steamer
chair with a cushion or two. The place looked very
inviting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now this out here,&#8221; said Roy, &#8220;is
my signal pedestal. You know Westy Martin, don&#8217;t
you? He&#8217;s patrol leader, and he and I are trying
out the Morse code; you&#8217;ll see me hand him one
to-night. We&#8217;re trying it by searchlight first,
then, later we&#8217;ll get down to the real fire works.
He lives out on the Hillside Road a little way.&#8221;</p>

<p>The signal pedestal was a little tower with a platform
on top reached by a ladder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t need to be very high, you see,
because you can throw a searchlight way up, but we
use it daytimes for flag work. Here&#8217;s the searchlight,&#8221;
Roy added, unwrapping it from a piece of canvas. &#8220;Belongs
on the touring car, but I use it. I let my father use
it on the car sometimes&#8212;&#173;if he&#8217;s good.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now for the coffee. Sit right down on that
parlor chair, but don&#8217;t lean too far back. Like
it strong? No? Right you are. Wait a minute, the lantern&#8217;s
smoking. Never thought what you were up against to-night,
did you? You&#8217;re kidnapped and don&#8217;t know
it. By the time we&#8217;re through the eats Westy&#8217;ll
be home and we&#8217;ll say good-night to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you beat that valley for signalling? Westy&#8217;s
nearly as high up as we are. Now for the fire and
then the plum-duff. Don&#8217;t be afraid of it-you
can only die once. Wish I had some raisin pudding,
but my mother turned me down on raisins to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat down on the ground near Tom, scaled his hat
into the tent, drew his knees up, and breathed a long,
exaggerated sigh of fatigue after his few minutes&#8217;
exertion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see, what was I going to ask you?
Oh, yes; how&#8217;d you get hunk on John Temple?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Put a quarantine sign on Sissy Bennett&#8217;s
house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure; didn&#8217;t yer see it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a rich guy, ain&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p>Roy looked at him, puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dere&#8217;s a gang comin&#8217; over from
Hillside ter s&#8217;prise him to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In a car?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye-re. An&#8217; I put de sign up fer ter sidetrack
&#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did?&#8221;</p>

<p>In the glare of the glowing fire Roy looked straight
at Tom. &#8220;How will that&#8212;&#173;what good&#8212;&#173;&#8221;
he began; then paused and continued to look curiously
at him with the same concentrated gaze with which he
would have studied a trail by night. But that was
not for long. A light came into his eyes. Hurriedly
he took out his watch and looked at it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nine o&#8217;clock,&#8221; he said, thoughtfully;
&#8220;they must have started back.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rose, all the disgust gone from his face, and slapped
Tom on the shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t he a rich guy?&#8221; explained
Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind that,&#8221; said Roy. &#8220;I&#8217;m
glad you told me&#8212;&#173;I&#8217;m going to show
you something as sure as you&#8217;re a foot high!
You and I are going to have the time of our lives
to-night, and <i>don&#8217;t you forget it!</i>&#8221;</p>

<br><br>
<h1><a name="#5">Chapter V</a></h1>

<h2>Connover&#8217;s Party</h2>

<p>&#8220;Quick, now, hand me the light and look out
you don&#8217;t trip on the wires. If they once get
past Westy&#8217;s house&#8212;&#173;g-o-o-d-<i>night!</i>
Just inside the garage door there you&#8217;ll see
a switch-turn it on. Here, take the lantern. If Westy
don&#8217;t get this right, we&#8217;ll kill him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom, with but the haziest idea of what was to be done,
followed directions. It evidently had something to
do with the mysterious &#8220;dot flares&#8221; and
with his own mean act. These excited nocturnal activities
had a certain charm, and if it wasn&#8217;t mischief
Roy was up to it had at least all the attractive qualities
of mischief.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll see a book just inside the tent&#8212;&#173;paper
covered&#8212;&#173;hand me that too, and come up yourself.
Look out for the wires,&#8221; cautioned Roy.</p>

<p>He opened the Scout Handbook to about the middle and
laid it flat on the tower rail.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the Morse Code,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;easy as eating ice cream when you once get
the hang of it. I know it by heart but I&#8217;m going
to let you read them to me so as to be sure. Better
be sure than be sorry&#8212;&#173;hey? I hope they
don&#8217;t speed that auto till we get through with
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can he answer?&#8221; ventured Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, they haven&#8217;t got a car at Westy&#8217;s
and no searchlight. He brings me the message all writ,
wrot, wrote out, in the morning. They&#8217;ve got
a dandy team there, though. Cracky, I&#8217;d rather
have a pair of horses than an auto any day, wouldn&#8217;t
you. Now be patient, Conny dear, and we&#8217;ll see
what we can do for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a long, long way to Tip&#8212;&#173;Hillside.
Do you s&#8217;pose Westy&#8217;s home yet? Oh yes,
sure, he must be. Well, here we go&#8212;&#173;take
the lantern and read off the ones I ask for and get
them right or I&#8217;ll-make you eat another plate
of plum-duff! Feeding with intent to kill, hey?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom couldn&#8217;t help laughing; Roy&#8217;s phrases
had a way of popping out like a Jack-in-the-Box.</p>

<p>He had a small makeshift wooden bracket which stood
on a grocery box on the tower platform, and in this
the auto searchlight swung.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a second now till I give him &#8216;Attention&#8217;
and then we&#8217;re off. Guess you must have seen
this light from downtown, hey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye-re, I wondered what&#8217;twas.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, here&#8217;s where you find out.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a little click as he turned the switch,
and then a long straight column of misty light shot
up into the darkness, bisecting the heavens. Far over
to the west it swung, then far to the east, while Tom
watched it, fascinated. Then he heard the click of
the switch again and darkness reigned, save for the
myriad stars.</p>

<p>It wac the first time in his life that Tom had ever
been charged with a real responsibility, and he waited
nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;That meant, &#8216;Get ready,&#8217;&#8221;
said Roy. &#8220;We&#8217;ll give him time to sharpen
his pencil. Do you pull much of a stroke with Machelsa,
the Indian spirit? She smiles a smile at me once in
a while, and if you want her to see you through any
kind of a stunt you just rub your cheek with one hand
while you pat your forehead with the other; try it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t do it, eh?&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;That&#8217;s
one of Mr. Ellsworth&#8217;s stunts; he got us all
started on that. You&#8217;d think the whole troop
was crazy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know him,&#8221; said Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the worst of the lot,&#8221; said
Roy. &#8220;Well, off we go, let&#8217;s have S-call
them dots and lines; some say &#8216;dashes&#8217;
but lines is quicker if you&#8217;re working fast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tree dots,&#8221; said Tom.</p>

<p>Three sudden flashes shot up into the sky, quickly,
one after another.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now T.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Line,&#8221; said Tom.</p>

<p>The switch clicked, and the long misty column rose
again, remaining for several seconds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now O.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;T&#8217;ree lines,&#8221; said Tom, getting
excited.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now P&#8212;&#173;and be careful&#8212;&#173;it&#8217;s
a big one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m on de job,&#8221; said Tom, becoming
more enthusiastic as he became more sure of himself.
&#8220;Dot&#8212;&#173;line&#8212;&#173;line&#8212;&#173;dot.&#8221;</p>

<p>The letter was printed on the open page of the heavens
and down in Barrel Alley two of the O&#8217;Connor
boys sitting on the rickety railing watched the lights
and wondered what they meant.</p>

<p>So, across the intervening valley to Westy&#8217;s
home, the message was sent. The khaki-clad boy, with
rolled-up sleeves, whose brown hand held the little
porcelain switch, was master of the night and of the
distance, and the other watched him admiringly.</p>

<p>Down at the Western Union office in Bridgeboro, the
operator sauntered out in his shirtsleeves and smilingly
watched the distant writing, which he understood.</p>

<p>Stop all autos send car with young folks back to
Bennett&#8217;s sure not practice serious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night,&#8221; said Roy, and two fanlike
swings of the misty column told that it was over.
&#8220;If they haven&#8217;t passed Westy&#8217;s yet,
we win. Shake, Tom,&#8221; he added, gayly, &#8220;You
did fine&#8212;&#173;you&#8217;re a fiend at it! Wouldn&#8217;t
you rather be here than at Conny&#8217;s party&#8212;&#173;honest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Would I?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we&#8217;ll rustle down the hill and see
the bunch co&#8217;me back&#8212;&#173;if they do.
Oh, cracky, don&#8217;t you hope they do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Do I?</i>&#8221; said Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Like the Duke of Yorkshire, hey? Ever hear
of him? Up the hill and down again. We&#8217;ll bring
the sign up for a souvenir, what do you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mebbe it oughter go back where it come from,&#8221;
said Tom, slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess you&#8217;re right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ever go scout&#8217;s pace?&#8221; said Roy.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fifty running-fifty walking. Try it and you&#8217;ll
use no other. Come on!<br>
The kind of pace you&#8217;ve always wanted,&#8221;
said Roy, jogging along.<br>
&#8220;Beware of substitutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was just about the time when Roy was showing Tom
his camp that a big touring car rolled silently up
to the outer gate of the Bennett place. (The house
stood well back from the road.) The car was crowded
with young people of both sexes, and it was evident
from their expressions of surprise and disappointment
that they saw the yellow sign on the gate.</p>

<p>There were a few moments of debate; some one suggested
tooting the horn, but another thought that might disturb
the patient; one proposed going to the house door
and inquiring, while still another thought it would
be wiser not to. Some one said something about &#8217;phoning
in the morning; a girl remarked that the last time
she saw Connover he had a headache and looked pale,
and indeed Connover&#8217;s general weakness, together
with the epidemic which prevailed in Bridgeboro, made
the appearance of the sign perfectly plausible.</p>

<p>The upshot was that the auto rolled away and turned
into the Hillside Turnpike. Scarcely had it gone out
of sight when a patch of light flickered across the
lawn, the shade was drawn from a window and the figure
of Mrs. Bennett appeared peering out anxiously.</p>

<p>Ten minutes out of Bridgeboro, as the big car silently
rolled upon the Hillside Turnpike, one of its disappointed
occupants (a girl) called,</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, see the searchlight!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, look,&#8221; said another.</p>

<p>The long, misty column was swinging across the heavens.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you see it, now you don&#8217;t,&#8221;
laughed one of the fellows, as Tom&#8217;s utterance
of &#8220;Dot,&#8221; sent a sudden shaft of light
into the sky and out again as quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is it, do you suppose?&#8221; asked one
of the girls.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does it mean anything?&#8221; asked another.</p>

<p>It meant nothing to them, for there was not a scout
in the car. And yet a mile or two farther along the
dark road there hung a lantern on an upright stick,
directly in their path, and scrawled upon a board below
it was the word, &#8220;Stop.&#8221;</p>

<p>Out of the darkness stepped a figure in a white sweater
(for the night was growing cold) and a large-brimmed
brown felt hat. One of his arms was braced akimbo
on his hip, the other hand he laid on the wind shield
of the throbbing auto.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me, did you come from Bennett&#8217;s
in Bridgeboro?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we did,&#8221; said a musical voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;d better turn and go back; there&#8217;s
a message here which says so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Back to Bennett&#8217;s? Really?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll read it to you,&#8221; said the
boy in the white sweater.</p>

<p>He held a slip of yellow paper down in front of one
of the acetylene headlights, and read,</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop all autos, send car with young folks back
to Bennett&#8217;s, sure.&#8221; (He did not read
the last three words on the paper.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you <i>ever</i> in <i>all</i>
your <i>life</i> know anything so perfectly extraordinary?&#8221;
said a girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can turn better right up there,&#8221;
said Westy. He was a quiet, uncommunicative lad.</p>

<p>The sign was gone from the Bennetts&#8217; gate when
the car returned, and the two boys standing in the
shadow across the way, saw the party go up the drive
and disappear into the house; there was still plenty
of time for the festive program.</p>

<p>They never knew what was said on the subject of the
sign and the mysterious telegram.</p>

<p>They kept it up at Bennetts&#8217; till long after
midnight. They played &#8220;Think of a Number,&#8221;
and &#8220;Button, button, who&#8217;s got the button?&#8221;
and wore tissue-paper caps which came out of tinselled
snappers, and had ice cream and lady-fingers and macaroons
and chicken salad.</p>

<p>When Connover went to bed, exhausted but happy, Mrs.
Bennett tripped softly in to say good-night to him
and to see that he had plenty of fresh air by &#8220;opening
the window a little at the top.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it much better, dearie,&#8221;
she said, seating herself for a moment on the edge
of the bed, &#8220;to find your pleasure right here
than to be tramping over the country and building
bonfires, and getting your clothing all filled with
smoke from smudge signals, or whatever they call them,
and catching your death of cold playing with searchlights,
like that Blakeley boy up on the hill? It&#8217;s just
a foolish, senseless piece of business, taking a boy&#8217;s
thoughts away from home, and no good can ever come
of it.&#8221;</p>

<h1><a name="#6">Chapter VI</a></h1>

<h2>Hitting the Bull&#8217;s Eye</h2>

<p>What did Tom Slade do after the best night&#8217;s
sleep he ever had? He went to Mrs. O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s,
where he knew he was welcome, and washed his face
and hands. More than that, he attended to his lessons
in school that day, to the teacher&#8217;s astonishment.
And why? Because he knew it was right? Not much! But
because he was anxious not to be kept in that afternoon
for he wanted to go down and peek through the fence
of Temple&#8217;s lot, to see if there were any more
wonders performed; to try to get a squint at Mr. Ellsworth
and Westy.</p>

<p>In short, Tom Slade had the Scout bug; he could not
escape it now. He had thrown it off once before, but
that was a milder dose. As luck would have it, that
very afternoon he had an amusing sidelight on the
scouting business which gave him his first knowledge
of the &#8220;good turn&#8221; idea, and a fresh glimpse
of the character of Roy Blakeley.</p>

<p>Inside Temple&#8217;s lot the full troop was holding
forth in archery practice and Tom peered through a
knothole and later ventured to a better view-point
on top of the fence.</p>

<p>When any sort of game or contest is going on it is
absolutely necessary to the boy beholder that he pick
some favorite whom he hopes to see win, and Tom lost
no time in singling Roy out as the object of his preference.</p>

<p>It was not a bad choice. As Roy stood sideways to
the target, his feet firmly planted, one bared brown
arm extended horizontally and holding the gracefully
curving bow, and the other, bent but still horizontal,
holding the arrow in the straining cord, he made an
attractive picture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s where I take the pupil out of
the Bull&#8217;s-eye,&#8221; he said, and the arrow
flew entirely free of the target.</p>

<p>&#8220;No sooner said than stung!&#8221; shouted Pee-wee
Harris.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, look who&#8217;s going to try,&#8212;&#173;mother,
mother, pin a rose on me!&#8221; shouted another boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, mother, turn the hose on me,&#8221;
called another.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand from behind in case the arrow goes backwards!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I bet he hits that fellow on the fence!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom could not help laughing as Mr. Ellsworth, with
unruffled confidence, stepped in place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oi&#8212;&#173;oi&#8212;&#173;oi&#8212;&#173;here&#8217;s
where Hiawatha turns over in his grave!&#8221;</p>

<p>It surprised Tom quite a little that they did not
seem to stand at all in awe of the scoutmaster. One
boy began ostentatiously passing his hat around.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the benefit of Sitting Bull Ellsworth,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;highest salaried artist in Temple&#8217;s
lot&#8212;&#173;positively last appearance this side
of the Rockies!&#8221;</p>

<p>But &#8220;Sitting Bull&#8221; Ellsworth had the laugh
on them all. Straight inside the first ring went his
arrow, and he stepped aside and gave an exceedingly
funny wink at Tom on the fence.</p>

<p>Tom changed his favorite.</p>

<p>Presently Roy sauntered over to the fence and spoke
to him. &#8220;Regular shark at it, isn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which one is Westy?&#8221; Tom asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Westy? That fellow right over there with the
freckles. If you get up close you can see the Big
Dipper on his left cheek. He&#8217;s got Orion under
his ear too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O&#8217;Brien?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Orion&#8212;&#173;it&#8217;s a bunch of
stars. Oh, he&#8217;s a regular walking firmament.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom stared at Westy. It seemed odd that the invisible
being who had caught that message out of the darkness
and turned the car back, should be right here, hobnobbing
with other mortals.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come over here, Westy,&#8221; shouted Roy,
&#8220;I want Tom Slade to see your freck&#8212;&#173;well,
I&#8217;ll be&#8212;&#173;if this one hasn&#8217;t shifted
way over to the other side. Westy&#8217;s our chart
of the heavens. This is the fellow that helped send
you the message last night, Westy. He ate two plates
of plum-duff and he lives to tell the tale.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand Roy kidnapped you,&#8221; said
Westy.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was fun all right,&#8221; said Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Too bad his parents put him out, wasn&#8217;t
it?&#8221; said Westy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever taste any of his biscuits?&#8221;
asked another fellow, who sauntered over. They formed
a little group just below Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got two of them in the Troop Room
we use for bullets,&#8221; he continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think of Camp Solitaire?&#8221;
Westy asked.</p>

<p>Tom knew well enough that they were making fun of
each other, but he did not exactly know how to participate
in this sort of &#8220;guying.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Sall right,&#8221; said he, rather weakly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think of the Eifel Tower?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Sall right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he show you the Indian moccasins Julia
made for him?&#8221;</p>

<p>This precipitated a wrestling match and Tom Slade
witnessed the slow but sure triumph of science, as
one after another the last speaker&#8217;s arms, legs,
back, neck and finally his head, yielded to the invincible
process of Roy&#8217;s patient efforts until the victim
lay prone upon the grass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Camp Solitaire all right?&#8221; Roy demanded,
laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said the victim and sprang up,
liberated.</p>

<p>Tom&#8217;s interest in these pleasantries was interrupted
by the voice of Mr. Ellsworth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come over here and try your hand, my boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, go ahead,&#8221; encouraged Westy, as
the group separated for him to jump down.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> couldn&#8217; hit it,&#8221;
hesitated Tom, abashed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither could he,&#8221; retorted Roy, promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you let him get away with the championship,&#8221;
said another boy, indicating the scoutmaster, &#8220;he&#8217;ll
have such a swelled head he won&#8217;t speak to us
for a month. Come ahead down and make a stab at it,
just for a stunt. You couldn&#8217;t do worse than
Blakeley.&#8221;</p>

<p>Everything was a &#8220;stunt&#8221; with the scouts.</p>

<p>Reluctantly, and smiling, half pleased and half ashamed,
Tom let himself down into the field and went over
to where the scoutmaster waited, bow and arrow in
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;A little more sideways, my boy,&#8221; said
Mr. Ellsworth; &#8220;turn this foot out a little;
bend your fingers like this, see? Ah, that&#8217;s
it. Now pull it right back to your shoulder&#8212;&#173;one&#8212;&#173;two&#8212;&#173;three&#8212;&#173;&#8221;
The arrow shot past the target, a full three yards
shy of it, past the Ravens&#8217; patrol flag planted
near by, and just grazed the portly form of Mr. John
Temple, who came cat-a-cornered across the field from
the gate.</p>

<p>A dead silence prevailed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I presume you have permission to use this property,&#8221;
demanded Mr. Temple in thundering tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good afternoon, Mr. Temple,&#8221; said the
scoutmaster.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good afternoon, sir. Will you be good enough
to let me see your authority for the use of these
grounds?&#8221; he demanded frigidly. &#8220;If I
gave any such permission I cannot seem to recall it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid, Mr. Temple,&#8221; said Mr. Ellsworth,
&#8220;that we can show no written word on&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes,&#8221; said the bank president, conclusively,
&#8220;and is it a part of your program to teach young
boys to take and use what does not belong to them?&#8221;</p>

<p>The scoutmaster flushed slightly. &#8220;No, that
is quite foreign to our program, Mr. Temple. Some
weeks ago, happening to meet your secretary I asked
him whether we might use this field for practice since
it is in a central and convenient part of town, and
he told me he believed there would be no objection.
Perhaps I should have&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you are under the impression that this
field belongs to my secretary?&#8221; asked Mr. Temple,
hotly. &#8220;If you have nothing better to do with
yourself than to play leader to a crew of&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Mr. Ellsworth interrupted him.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will leave the field at once, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When <i>I</i> was a young man,&#8221;
said Mr. Temple, with frosty condescension, &#8220;I
had something more important to do with myself than
to play Wild West with a pack of boys.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There were more open fields in those days,&#8221;
said the scoutmaster, pleasantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And perhaps that is why my wealth grows now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very likely; and the movement which these boys
represent,&#8221; Mr. Ellsworth added with a suggestion
of pride in his voice, &#8220;is growing quite as
fast as any man&#8217;s wealth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, sir! Do you know that this boy&#8217;s
father owes me money?&#8221; said Mr. Temple, coldly
indicating Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very likely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that the boy is a hoodlum?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Ellsworth bit his lip, hesitatingly. &#8220;Yes,
I know that, Mr. Temple,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;And a thief and a liar?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t run, Tom,&#8221; whispered Roy.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I <i>don&#8217;t</i> know that. Suppose
we talk apart, Mr. Temple.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will talk right here, and there&#8217;ll
be very little talking indeed. If you think I am a
public target, sir, you are quite mistaken! You clear
out of this lot and keep out of it, or you&#8217;ll
go to jail&#8212;&#173;the whole pack of you! A man
is known by the company he keeps. If you choose to
cast your lot with children&#8212;&#173;and hoodlums
and rowdies&#8212;&#173;I could send that boy to jail
if I wanted to,&#8221; he broke off. &#8220;<i>You
know</i> he&#8217;s a vicious character and yet
you&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>


<center>
<img alt="illus3.jpg (129K)" src="illus3.jpg" height="593" width="900">
<br />
<p>&#8220;Neither you nor any other man can break up this movement.&#8221;</p>
</center>
<br><br />



<p>The Scoutmaster looked straight into the eyes of the
enraged Temple, and there was a little prophetic ring
in his voice as he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it would be hard to say at
present just what he is, Mr. Temple. I was thinking
just a few minutes ago, as I saw him dangling his
legs up there, that he was on the fence in more ways
than one. I suppose we can push him down on either
side we choose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a right and wrong side to every
fence, young man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As every good citizen should know; a public
side and a private side.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has always been on the wrong side of the
fence hitherto, Mr. Temple.&#8221; Mr. Ellsworth held
out his hand and instinctively Tom shuffled toward
him and allowed the scoutmaster&#8217;s arm to encircle
his shoulder. Roy Blakeley elbowed his way among the
others as if it were appropriate that he should be
at Tom&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no wish to interfere with this &#8216;movement&#8217;
or whatever you call it,&#8221; said John Temple,
sarcastically, &#8220;provided you keep off my property.
If you don&#8217;t do that I&#8217;ll put the thumb-screws
on and see what the law can do, and break up your
&#8216;movement&#8217; into the bargain!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The law is helpless, Mr. Temple,&#8221; said
Mr. Ellsworth. &#8220;Oh, it has failed utterly. I
wish I could make you see that. As for breaking up
the movement,&#8221; he continued in quite a different
tone, &#8220;that is all sheer bluster, if you&#8217;ll
allow me to say so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; roared John Temple.</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither you nor any other man can break up
this movement.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As long as there are jails&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As long as there are woods and fields. But
I see there is no room for discussion. We will not
trespass again, sir; Mr. Blakeley&#8217;s hill is
ours for the asking. But you might as well try to bully
the sun as to talk about breaking up this movement,
Mr. John Temple. It is like a dog barking at a train
of cars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; said the capitalist, in
a towering rage, &#8220;that this boy hurled a stone
at me only a week ago?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not doubt it; and what are we going to
do about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do about it?&#8221; roared John Temple.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, do about it. The difference between you
and me, Mr. Temple, is that you are thinking of what
this boy did a week ago, and I am thinking of what
<i>he is going to do to-morrow</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys had the last word in this affair and it was
blazoned forth with a commanding emphasis which shamed
&#8220;old John&#8217;s&#8221; most wrathful utterance.
It was Roy Blakeley&#8217;s idea, and it was exactly
like him.</p>

<p>He invited the whole troop (Tom included) up to Camp
Solitaire and there, before the sun was too low, they
printed in blazing red upon a good-sized board the
words</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;TRESPASSING PROHIBITED<br>
&#160;&#160;UNDER PENALTY OF THE LAW</p>

<p>When darkness had fallen this was erected upon two
uprights projecting above the top of Temple&#8217;s
board fence.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll be sure to see it,&#8221; commented
Roy, &#8220;and it&#8217;s what he always needed.&#8221;</p>

<p>When a carpenter arrived on the scene the next morning
to put up such a sign, as per instructions, he went
back and told John Temple that there was a very good
one there already, and asked what was the use of another.</p>

<p>It was the kind of thing that Roy Blakeley was in
the habit of doing&#8212;&#173;a good turn with a dash
of pepper in it.</p>


<br><br>
<h1><a name="#7">Chapter VII</a></h1>

<h2>&#8220;On My Honor&#8221;</h2>

<p>During the next few days a dreadful document appeared
which had to do with Tom, though he never saw it and
only heard of it indirectly. Whence it emanated and
what became of it he never knew, but he knew it was
originated by the &#8220;rich guys&#8221; and that
Mrs. Bennett and John Temple and the Probation Officer
and the Judge had something to do with it.</p>

<p>It said that &#8220;Whereas one Thomas Slade, aged
fourteen, son of William Slade, whereabouts unknown,
and Annie Slade, deceased, was an unprotected minor,
<i>etc</i>., <i>etc</i>., that said Thomas Slade should
therefore be brought into court by somebody or other
at a certain particular time, for commitment as a
city charge,&#8221; and so forth and so on. There
was a good deal more to it than this, but this was
the part of it which Tom heard of, and he rose in
rebellion.</p>

<p>He had been sleeping, sometimes at Mrs. O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s
and sometimes up at Camp Solitaire with Roy, as the
fancy took him. When the news of what was under way
fell like a thunderbolt upon him, in a frenzy of apprehension
he went to Mr. Ellsworth.</p>

<p>Mr. Ellsworth himself went to court on the fatal day.
The judge asked what facilities the &#8220;Scout movement&#8221;
had for handling a boy like Tom Slade and whether
they had an &#8220;institution.&#8221; He thought Tom
might be placed under the supervision of competent
people in the Home for Wayward Boys. The Probation
Officer said that was just the place for Tom for he
had a &#8220;vicious proclivity.&#8221; Tom thought
presently he would be accused of having stolen that,
whatever it was. Happily, though, in the end, he was
committed to Mr. Ellsworth&#8217;s care and he and
Tom went forth together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now Tom,&#8221; said the Scoutmaster, &#8220;you
and I are going to have a little pow-wow&#8212;&#173;you
know what a pow-wow is? Well, then I&#8217;ll tell
you. When the Indians get together to chin about important
matters, they call it a pow-wow. They usually hold
it sitting around a camp fire, and we&#8217;ll do
that too when we get to Salmon River, for the Indians
haven&#8217;t got anything on us. But we&#8217;ll
have our first pow-wow right now walking along the
street. What do you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yer&#8212;&#173;yessir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You heard the judge say you haven&#8217;t any
relations and, in a way, he was right, but he was
mistaken, too, for a scout is a brother to every other
scout and you&#8217;ve got lots of brothers, thousands
of them; or will have when you get to be a scout.
And after you get to be a scout, why you&#8217;ll
have a pretty big pack to carry. The question is, can
you carry it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yessir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to carry the pack for all
these brothers of yours. If <i>you</i> make a
slip&#8212;&#173;tell a lie or throw a stone or interfere
with Ching Wo&#8212;&#173;everybody&#8217;ll say it&#8217;s
the Boy Scouts. Just the same as if Roy Blakeley should
send a flash message wrong. The telegraph operator
would give us the laugh and say the Scouts didn&#8217;t
know what they were doing. You and I&#8217;d get the
blame as well as Roy. So you see, Roy&#8217;s got
a pretty big pack to carry, but he manages to stagger
along with it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may have noticed that the Scouts are great
fellows for laughing. If there&#8217;s any laughing
to be done, we&#8217;re going to be the ones to do
it. We don&#8217;t let anybody else have the laugh.
That&#8217;s our middle name&#8212;&#173; laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one other little thing, and then
I&#8217;ll tell you the main thing I want to say&#8212;&#173;flash
it, as you fellows would say. We have to be careful
about talking. Stick your tongue out a little way between
your teeth and say them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Them,&#8221; said Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;The first thing for you to do is to make a
list of all the words you use that begin with th and
say them that way. You know we have troop calls and
patrol calls and all sorts of calls, and we&#8217;ve
got to be able to make them just right&#8212;&#173;see?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure-yessir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you take that word you use so much&#8212;&#173;&#8217;ye-re.&#8217;
&#8216;Yes&#8217; is better because it&#8217;s only
got three letters and you can flash it quicker. So
one of the first things to do is to make the school
books work overtime (there&#8217;s only two or three
weeks more) and get all those words just right; <i>them,
those, three</i>&#8212;&#173;because if you said
&#8216;tree&#8217; and meant &#8216;three&#8217; it
might throw everything endways. We have a lot to do
with trees in the summertime, and you want to be able
to say&#8217;three&#8217; just right, for another
reason.</p>

Outside Schmitt&#8217;s grocery they found a &#8220;Boy Wanted&#8221; sign.
</center>
<br><br />

<p>&#8220;There are three parts to the Scout Oath and
we don&#8217;t want to get those three parts mixed
with trees. So whenever you&#8217;re thinking of the
oath, say <i>three</i> and whenever you&#8217;re
thinking of going to Salmon River Grove, say tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy was much impressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Tom, the immediate thing to do is to go
down to Schmitt&#8217;s Grocery and take down that
sign he&#8217;s got outside.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told Roy Blakeley I wouldn&#8217;t take down
no more signs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can tell Roy you took this one down with
me&#8212;&#173;just for a stunt.&#8221;</p>

<p>Outside Schmitt&#8217;s Grocery they found a &#8220;Boy
Wanted&#8221; sign, and then Tom understood. He hesitated
a little when Mr. Ellsworth went in, for his relations
with Mr. Schmitt had not been altogether cordial.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d do, Mr. Schmitt,&#8221; said the
scoutmaster breezily. &#8220;How&#8217;s the Russian
advance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dem Roosians vill gett all vot&#8217;s coming
to dem,&#8221; said Mr. Schmitt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes? Well, how about this boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Veil, vot about him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He wants to take down that sign out there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Och! I know dot poy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you don&#8217;t; this is a different fellow&#8212;&#173;a
Boy Scout.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Veil, if dis iss der kind of a poy scouts&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, look here, Mr. Schmitt, don&#8217;t you
say anything about the Boy Scouts. Who stopped your
runaway horse for you last week?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say noddings about dem&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, a scout is a brother to every other scout,
and if you say anything against one you say it against
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>He winked significantly at Mr. Schmitt. &#8220;Come
back here, I want to speak to you,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>They retired to the rear of the store, where Mr. Schmitt
leaned his arm affectionately over the big wheel of
the coffee-grinder and listened, all attention.</p>

<p>Tom overheard the words, &#8220;fresh air,&#8221;
&#8220;Boys&#8217; Home,&#8221; &#8220;something to
do,&#8221; &#8220;appeal to honor,&#8221; &#8220;sense
of responsibility,&#8221; and more or less about woods
and country and about a &#8220;boy to-day being a man
to-morrow,&#8221; and about &#8220;working with him,&#8221;
and other odds and ends which he did not understand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Veil, it&#8217;s a goot ting, I&#8217;ll say
dot mooch,&#8221; said Mr. Schmitt, as they returned
to the front of the store. &#8220;Dere is too mooch
cities&#8212;&#173;dey don&#8217;t got no chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom,&#8221; said Mr. Ellsworth, &#8220;I&#8217;ve
been telling Mr. Schmitt about that signal work. (He
was wondering what the light was.) And I&#8217;ve told
him about your wanting to earn a little money before
camping time. He&#8217;s going to start you in on
three dollars and a half a week, school-days after
three and all day Saturdays and Saturday nights. He
asked me if you could deliver goods and I told him
there wasn&#8217;t a boy in town who could &#8220;deliver
the goods&#8221; like you. Remember the pack you&#8217;ve
got to carry for the whole troop. If you fall down,
you&#8217;ll queer the troop-Roy Blakeley and all
of us.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Schmitt&#8217;s a busy man and he has no
time to think of what you were doing a few days ago,
so don&#8217;t you think about that either. You can&#8217;t
follow a trail looking backward&#8212;&#173;you have
to keep your squinters ahead. Isn&#8217;t that so,
Mr. Schmitt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;d look forwards vile you are
going packwards,&#8221; said Mr. Schmitt. &#8220;You
come aroundt at dree o&#8217;clock, to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Tom,&#8221; said Mr. Ellsworth, as they
left the store, &#8220;my idea is for you to stay
at Mrs. O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s, and give her your money
every week. Roy says he&#8217;d like to have you go
up several nights a week and stay at Camp Solitaire,
so I think maybe three dollars a week to Mrs. O&#8217;Connor
will be all right. Then she&#8217;ll save the other
fifty cents for you and by the time we start for Salmon
River you&#8217;ll have enough, or pretty near enough,
for a uniform.</p>

<p>&#8220;For instance, you might go up to Camp Solitaire
every other night and eat plum-duff and eggs with
Roy. He says they&#8217;ve got chickens enough up
there to keep the camp going. He uses so many eggs,
one way or another, I should think he&#8217;d ashamed
to look a hen in the face. And remember about the
colors coming down at sunset. Uncle Sam&#8217;s a regular
old maid about such things, you know. And don&#8217;t
forget page&#8212;&#173;what was it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tree&#8212;&#173;three hundred and seventy-five,&#8221;
said Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll tell you all about the flag.
Then I want you to turn to page 28 in the Handbook
and study our law. We have our own home-made laws
same as everything else, plum-duff and fishing rods&#8212;&#173;all
home-made.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll want to know what you think of those
laws. I think they&#8217;re pretty good; Roy thinks
they&#8217;re great, but then Roy&#8217;s half crazy&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he isn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t know as much as he thinkgs
he does,&#8221; the scoutmaster came back.</p>

<p>&#8220;He knows all dem&#8212;&#173;them signs backwards.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll beat him out at it,&#8221; said
the scoutmaster. &#8220;Anyway, he&#8217;s going to
post you about the sign and the salute, and that leaves
only the knots. You take a squint at those knots in
the Handbook. I can improve on two of them, but I
won&#8217;t tell you how. You&#8217;ve got to get the
hang of four of them, and I want you to see if you
can&#8217;t do all this by Sunday afternoon. But remember,
Mr. Schmitt comes first.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Ellsworth blew into Mrs. O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s
with the same breezy pleasantry that he had shown
Mr. Schmitt, to the great edification and delight of
Sadie McCarren. He created quite a sensation in Barrell
Alley and Mrs. O&#8217;Connor, good woman that she
was, fell in with his plan enthusiastically.</p>

<p>The next morning Tom was up at six, wrestling with
the O&#8217;Connor clothes-line, and by half past
seven he had mastered the reef-knot and the weaver&#8217;s
knot, which latter he used to fasten two loose ends
of the broken line for permanent use, and he wondered
whether this by-product of his early morning practice
might pass as a &#8220;good turn.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before he went to school, Mrs. Beaman, a neighbor,
came in and said that after long consultation with
her husband she had decided to offer three dollars
for the Slade possessions, and in the absence of Bill
Slade, the estate was settled up in Tom&#8217;s interest
on that basis. So he went forth feeling he and John
Temple were alike in at least one thing-they were
both capitalists.</p>

<p>Mr. Ellsworth was somewhat of a stickler for form
and organization, and it was a pleasant scene which
took place the following Sunday afternoon under the
big elm up at Camp Solitaire. The ceremony of investing
a Tenderfoot was always held on a Sunday because he
believed it made it more impressive, and whenever
possible it was held out of doors.</p>

<p>The First Bridgeboro Troop was highly organized and
all its ceremonies emphasized the patrol. The two
patrols, the Ravens and the Silver Foxes (and later
the Elks) participated in the investing ceremony, but
it was the affair particularly of the patrol into
which the Tenderfoot was to enter, and this idea was
worked out in the ceremony.</p>

<p>Each patrol stood grouped about its flag, and a little
apart, near the national colors, stood Mr. Ellsworth
and Worry Sage, Troop Scribe, armed with a book and
fountain pen. Down near the signal pedestal was Roy&#8217;s
sister, Esther, in company with her mother and one
or two servants from the house. Carl, the gardener,
was there, too, to watch the ceremony.</p>

<p>Roy Blakeley, as sponsor for the new member, stepped
forward with Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whom have you here?&#8221; Mr. Ellsworth said,
in accordance with their regular form.</p>

<p>&#8220;An applicant for membership in our Troop and
a voice in our councils,&#8221; answered Roy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he worthy to be a member of our Troop?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I come as his friend and his brother,&#8221;
said Roy, &#8220;and to certify that he is as desirable
to us as we to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has he made satisfactory proof of the tests?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And is he prepared to take the oath?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is prepared.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Raise your right hand in the Scout Salute,&#8221;
Mr. Ellsworth said to Tom.</p>

<p>Then Worry Sage stepped forward and repeated the oath,
Tom following him, line by line:</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;On my honor I will do my best&#8212;&#173;<br>
&#160;&#160;To do my duty to God and my country, and
to obey the scout law;<br>
&#160;&#160;To help other people at all times;<br>
&#160;&#160;To keep myself physically strong, mentally
awake, and morally<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;straight.</p>

<p>&#8220;How say you? Is this applicant familiar with
the law?&#8221; asked the scoutmaster.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is familiar with the law and finds it good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let the law be read.&#8221;</p>

<p>Worry Sage read the first law, which was the one Tom
broke when he stole Mary Temple&#8217;s ball.</p>

<p>&#8220;You find this law good?&#8221; asked the scout-master.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes sir, I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Worry read the next one, &#8220;A Scout is loyal.
He is loyal to all to whom loyalty is due; his scout
leader, his home and parents and country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You find this law good?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a slight pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I have to obey that one?&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Do I have ter be loyal ter him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Ellsworth stepped forward amid a tense silence
and laid his hand on Tom&#8217;s shoulder. &#8220;I
think you have been loyal to your mother already,
Tom,&#8221; he said in a low tone, &#8220;as for your
father,&#8221; he hesitated; &#8220;yes, I think you
must be loyal to him too. There weren&#8217;t any Boy
Scouts when he was a boy, Tom. We must remember that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;You find this law good?&#8221; asked the scoutmaster,
resuming the ceremonial form.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8212;&#173;I do. I&#8217;ll be&#8212;&#173;loyal.&#8221;</p>

<p>The reading of the law completed, he stepped back
with Roy to the Silver Fox emblem.</p>

<p>The Silver Fox patrol leader asked, &#8220;Do you
promise to stand faithful to this emblem, and to these
your brother scouts of the Silver Fox Patrol?&#8221;</p>

<p>And then, &#8220;Are you familiar with the patrol
call which is the voice of the silver fox, and with
the patrol sign, which is the head of the silver fox,
and do you promise to use this call and this sign and
no other so that your name may be honorable in all
the Troop, and among all troops?&#8221;</p>

<p>And Tom answered, &#8220;I promise.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Ellsworth pinned the Tenderfoot Badge on his breast.</p>

<p>Tom Slade of Barrel Alley had become a Scout. He could
not see where the trail led, but that he had hit the
right one he felt sure.</p>


<br><br>
<h1><a name="#8">Chapter VIII</a></h1>

<h2>Stung!</h2>

<p>&#8220;Got the linen thread?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right here in the tin cup.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, put the tin cup in the pint measure
and the pint measure in the coffee-pot; now put the
coffee-put in the kettle and the kettle in the duffel-bag.
Then put the duffel-bag in the corner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;ll I put the corner?&#8221; laughed
Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;There we are,&#8221; said Roy, &#8220;all ready
before the Ravens have started to pack. They ought
to be called the &#8216;Snails.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>They were up at Camp Solitaire, the whole patrol,
and the standing of the duffel-bag in the corner of
the tent was the last act of a busy day.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be sorry to see Camp Solitaire break
up,&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had some good
sport up here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There hasn&#8217;t been much &#8216;solitaire&#8217;
to it lately,&#8221; said Eddie Ingram.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, down it comes in the morning,&#8221;
said Roy. &#8220;What are we going to catch, the three-thirty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I bet the Ravens won&#8217;t be ready,&#8221;
said one of the boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be just like them,&#8221; observed
an-other.</p>

<p>&#8220;And we&#8217;ll have to wait for the five-fifteen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then Esther Blakeley came running out from the
house.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw Walter Harris,&#8221; said she, panting
from running and excitement, &#8220;and he told me
to tell you that if the Ravens aren&#8217;t at the
station not to wait for them but go right along on
the three-thirty and they&#8217;ll see you later at
Salmon River Grove.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did I tell you!&#8221; laughed Roy. &#8220;Can
you beat the Snail Patrol?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah for the Turtles!&#8221; shouted Westy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if they didn&#8217;t
show up till the next day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or next week,&#8221; said Tom.</p>

<p>The Ravens were not on hand for the three-thirty next
day and the<br>
Silver Foxes went without them, bag and baggage.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re some rear guard, all right,&#8221;
said Roy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bet they&#8217;re still buying fishing-tackle,&#8221;
said Westy.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Also Ran Patrol,&#8221; commented Dorry
Benton.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Last Gasp Patrol,&#8221; said another boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Tardy Turtles,&#8221; ventured Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have our tent up before they leave
Bridgeboro&#8212;&#173;you see,&#8221; said Roy. &#8220;Somebody
ought to set a fire-cracker off underneath that patrol&#8212;&#173;
they&#8217;re hopeless.&#8221;</p>

<p>Salmon River Grove was about an hour out on the train.
Some of the wealthier of the Bridge-boro people had
cottages there. The Bennetts had a pretty bungalow
in the village and here, in a hammock on the wide
veranda, Connover was wont to loll away the idle summer
hours in cushioned ease, reading books about boys
who dwelt in the heavens above and in the earth beneath
and in the waters under the earth. They went down
in submarines, these boys, and up in airships, and
to the North Pole and the South Pole and the Desert
of Sahara. They were all Boy Scouts and it was from
these books that Mrs. Bennett gleaned her notions
of scouting.</p>

<p>It was a dangerous season for Connover, for in the
spring his fancy softly turned to thoughts of scouting,
but Mrs. Bennett stood guard against these perils
with a tennis racquet and a bottle of cod liver oil
and a backgammon board and an automatic piano. And
so by hook or crook Connover was tided over the dangerous
season, and allowed to read the <i>Dan Dreadnought
Series</i> as a sort of compromise.</p>

<p>But the show place at Salmon River Grove was Five
Oaks, the magnificent new estate of John Temple with
its palatial rubble-stone residence, its garage and
hot-houses and &#8220;No Trespassing&#8221; signs,
of which latter he had the finest collection of any
man in the state. The latest edition of these did
not say &#8220;No Trespassing&#8221; at all, but simply,
&#8220;Keep out.&#8221; These signs stood about the
newly graded lawns seeming to shake their fists at
the curious who peered at the great tur-retted structure.</p>

<p>Mr. Blakeley, Roy&#8217;s father, also owned an extensive
tract of woods a little way from the village and here
the First Bridgeboro Troop was monarch of all it surveyed
from the day school closed until almost the day it
opened; and here Mr. Ellsworth spent the happy days
of a well-earned vacation, going into town occasionally
as business demanded.</p>

<p>From Salmon River Grove Station the Silver Fox Patrol
had to hike it out for about three miles, and when
they hit Camp Ellsworth (as the boys insisted upon
calling it) there was the Ravens&#8217; tent pitched
under the trees, and the Ravens&#8217; flag flying,
and the Ravens&#8217; fire crackling away, and the
Ravens themselves gathered about it. On a tree was
displayed a glaring sign done in charcoal, which read,</p>

<p>The Follow-Afters are cordially invited to dine with
the Rapid Ravens. Supper is ready and</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;WAITING.</p>

<p>When Mr. Ellsworth came out from Bridgeboro at seven
o&#8217;clpck, he declined to be interviewed as to
what he might know of this affair. But whatever he
knew, it was evident that the whole plan was known
in another quarter, for the very next day the &#8220;mail-hiker&#8221;
(who was Dorry Benton) brought up from Salmon River
Village a post card addressed to Roy, which read,</p>

<p>&#8220;MR. SMARTY:</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you know by this time the cause of
my &#8216;scout smile.&#8217; Do you still think Walter
Harris is a turtle?</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;ESTHER.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scout-Pace Pee-wee got possession of this card, made
an elaborate birch, bark frame for it, and hung it
up in the Ravens&#8217; tent, where it remained ostentatiously
displayed until the bitter day of reckoning, which
came not long after.</p>

<p>To Tom Slade the wretched, slum-stained boy whose
whole poor program had been to call names and throw
stones, the camp routine, the patrol rivalries and
reprisals, the hikes, the stunts, the camp-fire yarns,
the stalking and tracking, were like the designs in
a kaleidoscope.</p>

<p>Observant persons noticed how he began to say &#8220;I
saw&#8221; instead of &#8220;I seen&#8221;; &#8220;those&#8221;
instead of &#8220;them,&#8221; and how his speech improved
in many other ways. This was largely in the interest
of the signalling, about which he had come to be a
perfect fiend. It sent him to the dictionary to find
out how to spell words which were to be flashed or
wigwagged; and from spelling them properly he came
to pronounce them properly.</p>

<p>When he found that it was possible to tell a piece
of oak from a piece of ash by smelling it, if the
sense of smell were good, why, that was a knock-out
blow for cigarettes. He wasn&#8217;t going to let the
Ravens get away with that species of scouting proficiency.</p>

<p>Next to signalling work the thing that engrossed Tom&#8217;s
thoughts was tracking, which he was forever practicing
and which he now looked to as the one remaining accomplishment
which would advance him to the Second Class.</p>

<p>More than a month of scout life had passed for him
and he was eligible in that particular; he was ready,
though a trifle shaky, on the &#8220;first aid&#8221;
business; as for signalling, he had but one rival and
that was Roy; and he could jog along at scout pace
with anyone except Pee-wee. He was prepared to chop
his way into the Second Class with knife or hatchet,
as per requirements; he could kindle a fire in the
open and cook you a passable meal, though he would
never be the equal of Roy as a chef.</p>

<p>He knew the points of the compass also, and there
were but two things about which he was still in doubt.
These were the tracking and the financial business.
He felt that if he could do a good tracking stunt
it might compensate for his lack in cooking proficiency
and for his omission in another particular.</p>

<p>It was now the ambition of his life to be a Second
Class Scout; he thought of it by day and dreamed of
it by night, and he wrestled with a dogged persistence
with those things in which he was not skillful because
they were not in his line.</p>

<p>It was in the interest of this ambition that he joined
Mr. Ellsworth one morning as the latter was starting
out from camp on one of his &#8220;auto confabs,&#8221;
as the boys called his strolls, for on these he was
wont to formulate new policies and schemes and, as
a rule, he went alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along, Tommy boy,&#8221; said he cheerily.
&#8220;Got something you want to say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. I think I can do that tracking stunt
in Paragraph Four an&#8217; if I do an&#8217; make
it a good one, I was wondering if&#8212;&#173;I s&#8217;pose&#8212;&#173;would
you&#8212;&#173;would you think those potatoes I cooked
yesterday were all right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very fair, Tommy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would it pass for Test Eight?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I think maybe so; we all have our specialties,
Tom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a little shaky on first aid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you can get away with that all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well then,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;there&#8217;s
only one thing to prevent&#8212;&#173;that is, if I
do the tracking stunt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes? What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about the money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir; I&#8217;ve got that five dollars
Mr. Schmitt gave me for the extra work when he opened
the branch store.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;ve you got that, Tom?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got it &#8217;round my neck on a
strong cord. I made a bow line knot. It&#8217;s in
my membership book to keep it clean.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a new bill and he had always kept it clean.</p>

<p>&#8220;The rule says it must be in the bank&#8212;&#173;one
dollar anyway. But I don&#8217;t want to break it.
One day I was going to ask Roy to give me five ones
for it and then I decided not to. I like one bill better,
don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I don&#8217;t know but what I do, Tom,&#8221;
said Mr. Ellsworth, smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I tell you it was a new one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, &#8217;tis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Tommy. Don&#8217;t you worry about
that. Just keep the bow line knot good and tight and
think of potatoes and bandages and if you can make
that tracking stunt something special so as to just
knock the Commissioner off his feet, I guess it&#8217;ll
land you in the Second Class. One thing has to make
up for another, you know. I&#8217;ve got to stand guard
because if I didn&#8217;t you fellows would be all
waltzing scout-pace into the Second Class. But don&#8217;t
worry about financial matters&#8212;&#173;that&#8217;s
what&#8217;s turning Mr. Temple&#8217;s hair gray.
When I go into town I&#8217;ll put that five-spot
in the bank for you, hey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then if I took it out of the bank would it
be the same bill?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it would be a different one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But would it be a new one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you wanted a new one they&#8217;d give you
a new one. Now you hike it back to camp and tell Worry
there are to be no leaves of absence to-night on account
of camp-fire yarns, and to post a notice. Tell him
to make duplicate prints of the chipmunk Eddie stalked
and paste one in the Troop Book. I&#8217;ve got a
call to make up toward the village.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom made him the full salute and started back. That
night he dreamed that the &#8220;Be Prepared&#8221;
scroll was pinned upon him and that he was a Silver
Fox Scout of the Second Class, having passed with much
distinction.</p>

<p>Mr. Ellsworth had designs on the Bennett bungalow
and he blew into the porch like a refreshing breeze
that sultry morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Connie, old boy,&#8221; he called to
the youth in the hammock. &#8220;How&#8217;s the state
of your constitution?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a little touch of rheumatism,&#8221;
said Connover.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; said the scoutmaster. &#8220;What
right have <i>you</i> got to have rheumatism?
I thought John Temple had a controlling interest in
all the rheumatism around here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It gets me in the arm,&#8221; said Connover.</p>

<p>&#8220;So? That&#8217;s too bad. May I lift these
books off the chair, Connie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely&#8212;&#173;sit down. Just push them
on the floor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Regular Carnegie Library, eh? What are they
all about, Con?&#8221;</p>

<p>Connover quite welcomed the interruption for Mr. Ellsworth&#8217;s
offhand cordiality was nothing less than contagious.
He fell immediately and completely into the spirit
of whatever was on the boards.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Bout the Boy Scouts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&#8212;&#173;really?&#8221; said Mr. Ellsworth,
running through one of the volumes amusedly. &#8220;Who&#8217;s
this fellow, Dan Dreadnought?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s lieutenant of the Eureka Patrol.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So? I thought maybe he was a battleship from
his name. And what does Dan do to pass the time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This one I&#8217;m reading now,&#8221; said
Connover, &#8220;is the <i>Eureka Patrol in the
Fiji Islands; Dan stabs two natives.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out! Does he really?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the captain of the squad&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What squad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of Boy Scouts-the captain is taken prisoner
by the cannibals&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say! How many of these books
are there, Connie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty-seven&#8212;&#173;all one series.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Dan&#8217;s some boy, isn&#8217;t he?
How would you like to be a scout, Connie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother wouldn&#8217;t let me have a musket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They all have muskets, do they?&#8221;</p>

<p>At this point Mrs. Bennett appeared and greeted the
scoutmaster cordially. She could never find it in
her heart to dislike Mr. Ellsworth.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d do, Mrs. Bennett.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, Mr. Ellsworth,&#8221; she said,
and added smilingly, &#8220;I hope you are not trying
to contaminate Connover again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me? Oh, dear, no! A fellow who can witness
the murder of two innocent South Sea natives isn&#8217;t
in much danger from me!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Mrs. Bennett failed to see the point.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell Connover,&#8221; said Mrs. Bennett,
&#8220;that if it must be&#8217;scouts&#8217; and
&#8216;wild west&#8217; it is better in the books than
in real life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s a matter of taste, Mrs.
Bennett. You can have Dan What&#8217;s-his-name up
here, if you want to, but I wouldn&#8217;t allow him
near my camp. No siree!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet he&#8217;s a scout boy,&#8221; said Mrs.
Bennett triumphantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;From all I can see he&#8217;s a silly blackguard.
Why, Mrs. Bennett,&#8221; added the scoutmaster pleasantly,
&#8220;you&#8217;ve hit the wrong trail&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hit the wrong trail. We don&#8217;t have &#8216;Eureka&#8217;
Patrols or captains or lieutenants or squads or muskets.
This book has got no more to do with real scouting
than it has with a Sunday School picnic. I tell you
what, Mrs. Bennett, I just came up out of the woods,
and I tell you it&#8217;s a shame that good trees
should be cut down to get wood-pulp to make paper
on which to print such stuff as this! It&#8217;s a
waste of good trees!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have always done everything for Connover&#8212;&#173;&#8221;
began Mrs. Bennett.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, do one thing more for him and let him
come and join the scouts-the real scouts. That&#8217;s
what I wanted to see you about. I&#8217;m going to
work up a new patrol, the Elks. Like that name, Connie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I want Connie in the Elks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite out of the question, Mr. Ellsworth.
I am willing that he should read about them, but there
it must end. We have always done everything for Connover.
I have never stinted him in the matter of wholesome
pleasure of any kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t call murder wholesome pleasure,
do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here he is under my eye. There is no use arguing
the matter. I have no thought but of Connie&#8217;s
welfare and happiness, but I am not willing that he
should dress up like Mrs. Blakeley&#8217;s boy&#8212;&#173;a
perfect <i>sight</i>&#8212;&#173;his clothes <i>redolent</i>
of smoke-and play with fire and sleep in a draught.&#8221;</p>

<img alt="illus5.jpg (102K)" src="illus5.jpg" height="576" width="869">
<br />
Mrs. Temple was too weak to walk and the boys improvised a litter for her.
</center>
<br><br />

<p>&#8220;There aren&#8217;t any draughts outdoors, Mrs.
Bennett.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the damp air. Oh, it&#8217;s
quite out of the question!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think those O&#8217;Connor
boys would be better out here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think a boy is better in his home, where
his mother is. I have done everything for Connover&#8212;&#173;everything,
and he is ready to do this much for me. Aren&#8217;t
you, dearie?&#8221;</p>

<p>As Mr. Ellsworth walked back to camp through the silent
woods, he was puzzled at the reasoning of the fond
mother who thought that <i>Dan Dreadnought</i>
was a better companion for her son than Roy Blakeley.</p>


<br><br>
<h1><a name="#9">Chapter IX</a></h1>

<h2>&#8220;Burglars&#8221;</h2>

<p>On one of their morning rambles, Mrs. Temple and Mary
wandered to an unusual distance from home, and as
the sun mounted higher Mrs. Temple felt greatly fatigued.
Mary looked about for a spot where her mother might
sit down and rest, but was startled by a slight sound
and ran back just as Mrs. Temple sank fainting against
a tree.</p>

<p>Greatly frightened, the girl looked wildly around
for assistance, but there was no house nor sign of
life in sight. Not knowing what to do she ran along
the road a little way, calling aloud, when suddenly
she heard a sound. Pausing to listen she distinctly
heard again what sounded like a bugle call, and turning
in the direction from which it seemed to come she
ran through the woods until she came, breathless, to
the camp of the Bridgeboro Scouts.</p>

<p>It happened that the Silver Foxes were that morning
practising in first aid, and as soon as Mr. Ellsworth
could gather from the frightened girl that her mother
was in real need, he rushed &#8220;Doc&#8221; Carson,
the first-aid boy, and Roy off to the rescue, instructing
the other members of the patrol to follow scout pace.</p>

<p>Water was brought and Mrs. Temple quickly revived.
Her head had been slightly cut as she fell, and this
Carson bandaged skilfully. She was still too weak
to walk, however, and the boys improvised a litter
in which she was carefully borne back to camp, Mary
walking at her side.</p>

<p>The Ravens, meanwhile, under Mr. Ellsworth&#8217;s
direction, had prepared a sort of couch of fir boughs.
Onto this they helped Mrs. Temple and the scoutmaster
sat down beside her.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was not entirely by chance that he had
instructed the two patrols to go through their signalling
maneuvers at a little distance, so that they should
not disturb the invalid, but yet in full view and
near enough so that she might follow the course of
the proceedings if she cared to. Mary had a thousand
questions to ask as to the meaning of the various
signals, and the kind scoutmaster answered them all
patiently, finally summoning Eddie Ingram to show her
about the camp and explain all its mysteries. Then,
seeing that Mrs. Temple showed some interest in the
maneuvers, the guileful Mr. Ellsworth proceeded to
explain their practical value and the good uses to
which the scout &#8220;stunts&#8221; were often put,
tactfully pointing out the change that had taken place
in Tom Slade, who at this moment was bashfully showing
Mary how to blow whistle signals on a small bottle.</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple, however, showed but a courteous interest,
and feeling that her husband would be alarmed at her
long absence she called to Mary and insisted upon
returning home immediately, despite Mr. Ellsworth&#8217;s
urgent invitation that she stay and share the scouts&#8217;
luncheon.</p>

<p>The Silver Fox patrol was ordered to escort the ladies
home, and with this ample bodyguard they returned
to Five Oaks, the boys laughingly contesting for the
honor of walking with Miss Mary&#8212;&#173;all save
Tom, who lingered somewhat shamefacedly in the rear.</p>

<p>As they walked up the gravel path through the spacious
lawn, it was evident that something was wrong. One
of the servants was in the <i>portecochere</i>,
wringing her hands, and the stoical Japanese valet
stood near her, calm and unsmiling.</p>

<p>The unusual sight of the uniformed scouts did not
seem to ruffle him at all.</p>

<p>Carl, the gardener, was craning his neck to look up
and down the road from the window of the library,
a room which he would never have dared to enter save
on a very urgent matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Mr. Temple?&#8221; Mrs. Temple asked.
&#8220;I have had quite an adventure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m&#8212;&#173;he went after you, ma&#8217;am&#8212;&#173;with
the runabout. He thought you was lost and he took
on so&#8212;&#173;not knowing which way to go at all&#8212;&#173;and
he sent James the other way to look for you&#8212;&#173;an&#8217;
there was burglars&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was someone entered the house an&#8217;
has gone away an&#8217; all Miss Mary&#8217;s things
out of her bureau is all over the bed&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>The story of the afternoon&#8217;s events was quickly
extracted from the excited servant, prompted by Carl
and the Jap. Mr. Temple, having grown anxious about
the prolonged absence of his wife and daughter, had
started out in the runabout in quest of them. The butler
had been sent in another direction and shortly thereafter
one of the maids had heard footsteps on the floor
above. Thinking that Mrs. Temple must have returned,
she went upstairs when, to her terror, a frightful-looking
man brushed past her and went down the back stairs.
She had screamed, and Carl and Kio had both come to
her, but a search of the house and grounds had not
discovered the burglar. The screen in the pantry window
was ripped away, and Kio volunteered the suggestion
that the &#8220;honorable burglar gentleman&#8221;
had made his exit through it.</p>

<p>A systematic search of all the rooms by Mrs. Temple
and the patrol revealed no loss or evidence of ransacking
except that in Mary&#8217;s room the contents of the
top bureau drawer were disheveled and some trinkets
and an upset box lay upon the bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looked as if they were interrupted,&#8221;
said Roy.</p>

<p>&#8220;They took my class pin,&#8221; said Mary, running
over the things. &#8220;Oh, isn&#8217;t that a shame!
I don&#8217;t care what else they took&#8212;&#173;that&#8217;s
the only thing I care about! Oh, I think they were
too mean for anything! It was my class pin!&#8221;
She was crying a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t worth very much, dear,&#8221;
said her mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t that,&#8221; said the girl;
&#8220;you don&#8217;t understand. I thought as much
of it as you boys do of those badges.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; said Westy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, we understand&#8212;&#173;don&#8217;t
we, Tom?&#8221; said Roy.</p>

<p>Tom said nothing his eyes were fixed on the girlish
trinkets which lay in confusion on the bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it was too mean of them,&#8221; Mary
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d ask papa to give them my ruby out
of his safe if they&#8217;d only bring that back!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did Tom go?&#8221; asked Westy, noticing
that Tom had left the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess maybe he&#8217;s afraid he might meet
Mr. Temple,&#8221; whispered Dorry Benton. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t believe he wants to see him, and I don&#8217;t
blame him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom had gone downstairs and around the house to the
pantry window. Nothing was farther from his thoughts
than John Temple, but in those few minutes upstairs
something had been said which recalled to his mind
something else which had been said in the same half-doubtful,
half-trustful voice, many weeks before. &#8220;<i>Will
you promise to toss it back?</i>&#8221; And out
of the past he heard a rough, sneering voice answer,
&#8220;<i>Sure, didn&#8217; I tell yer?</i>&#8221;
The words, &#8220;<i>If they&#8217;d only bring
that back</i>,&#8221; seemed almost to counter-felt
that haunting voice out of the past, and they stung
Tom Slade like a white-hot coal.</p>

<p>The rubber ball, which had been the subject of the
half-pleading question, had gone the way of most rubber
balls, and the memory of the episode would have gone
the way of all such memories in the hoodlum mind,
except that something had happened to Tom Slade since
then. He was familiar now with Paragraph I, Scout
Law, and was presently to show that he had pondered
on other paragraphs of that law as well.</p>

<p>Outside the pantry window was a nail keg and on this
Tom sat down. It was in a jog formed by an angle in
the back of the house, and there was not much danger
of being seen from any of the rear ground floor windows,
for these were all of heavy cathedral glass. The ground
beneath them was littered with nails and shavings;
a scrap or two of colored glass and some little bars
of lead lay strewn about where the men had been working.</p>

<p>Presently he heard voices and guessed that his companions
were leaving. Then he heard the honk of an auto horn
and caught a fleeting glimpse of a gray car rolling
up the private way toward the <i>porte-cochere</i>.
He heard other voices, the excited greetings of Mrs.
Temple and Mary, and the sonorous and authoritative
tones of John Temple.</p>

<p>For a moment he forgot what he had come out here for,
as he realized that it would be difficult to leave
without being seen. His hatred of John Temple had
modified somewhat since he had become a scout, and
had now given place to a feeling of awe for the man
who could own a place of such magnificence as Five
Oaks. Never before had Tom been in such a house. He
had supposed that Roy&#8217;s beautiful home was about
the most luxurious abode imaginable. He realized now
that he was stranded in this despotic kingdom with
&#8220;No Trespassing&#8221; signs all about glaring
at him like sentinels.</p>

<p>Tom had acquired many of the scout virtues and his
progress in the arts (save in one or two which he
could not master) had been exceptional. But he had
still to acquire that self-confidence and self-possession
which are the invariable result of good breeding. He
had not felt at home in the house and though his conscience
was perfectly clear, he was ill at ease now.</p>

<p>Presently he heard voices again; he saw the car leave
with the chauffeur alone, and heard the smothered
ringing of the telephone bell in the house.</p>

<p>These evidences of the power of wealth hit his boyish
imagination hard, and for a minute John Temple seemed
like a hero. He could despatch a car to Bridgeboro,
another to Keensburgh; he could call up every police
station in the state and offer rewards which would
cause sheriffs and constables to sit up and take notice.
He could pay ten thousand dollars for the capture
of the man who had stolen that little class pin. John
Temple might be an old grouch, but he was a wonderful
man!</p>

<p>Then the words came rushing into Tom&#8217;s head
again, <i>Will you promise to toss it back?</i>
and those other words, <i>If they would only bring
it back!</i></p>

<p>Then he remembered what he had come out here for,
and it seemed very silly and futile alongside the
approved methods which were being followed within.
While he knew the Scout Handbook did not lie, just
the same he hesitated to give this deducing and tracking
business a practical test. Then, suddenly, there came
to his mind the words Mr. Ellsworth was so fond of
repeating to the troop, <i>He who has eyes to see,
let him see</i>.</p>


<br><br>
<h1><a name="#10">Chapter X</a></h1>

<h2>Tom Turns Detective</h2>

<p>As Tom rose he saw that the fresh paint on the pantry
window ledge had been smeared. Then he looked at the
ground. Below the window was a long smooth mark on
the soil. &#8220;The fellow had jumped from that window,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;slid when he touched the groun&#8217;.&#8221;
He stopped, but not to pick up a rock. Then he went
down on his hands and knees, with never a thought of
those treasured khaki trousers, and while the telephone
bell rang and rang again in the house he read the
writing which is written all over the vast, open page
of nature for those who have eyes and know how to
see.</p>

<p>He was very much engrossed now; he forgot everything.
He was a scout of the scouts, and he screwed up his
face and studied the ground as a scholar pores over
his books.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh,&#8221; said he, &#8220;his shoes need
soling, that&#8217;s one sure thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>He examined with care a little thin crooked indentation
in the soil, as if a petrified angleworm had been
pushed into the hard earth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I hope he kicked
into it hard enough so it stays there.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was satisfied that the fugitive&#8217;s shoe was
worn in the sole so that the outer layer, worn thin
and flopping loose, had slid onto one of the little
malleable leaden bars used in the cathedral-glass windows.
This had evidently pushed its way into the tattered
sole, bent a little from the impact, and lodged securely.
Either the fugitive did not feel it, or did not care
to pause and remove it. It made a mark as plain as
Tom&#8217;s patrol sign.</p>

<p>He cast one apprehensive look at the open windows
of the upper floor and, taking a chance, made a bold
dash across the rear lawn, where he thought he could
discern footprints in the newly-sprouting grass. Several
hundred feet away was the boundary fence and here the
correctness of his direction was confirmed by a painty
smooch on the top rail where the fugitive had climbed
over.</p>

<p>Tom leaped across the fence and, as usual, after any
vigorous move, he felt instinctively to see if his
precious five-dollar bill was safe. He lived in continual
dread of losing it. He paused a minute scrutinizing
the small crooked marks left by the leaden bar. Then
he thought of something which added fresh zest to
his thus far successful search. It was provision four
of the Second Class Scout tests:</p>

<p>Track half a mile in twenty-five minutes, or,...</p>

<p>&#8220;If I do that,&#8221; said he, looking at his
dollar watch, &#8220;it&#8217;ll land me in the Second
Class with a rush, and if I should get the pin for
her that would knock the Commissioner off his feet,
all right. Here&#8217;s my tracking stunt mapped out
for me. I never claimed I could cook. Oh, cracky,
here&#8217;s my chance!&#8221;</p>

<p>He got the word &#8220;Cracky&#8221; from Roy.</p>

<p>As he turned and cast a last look toward the house
someone (a woman, he thought) seemed to be waving
her arm from one of the upper casements. He could
not make up his mind whether she was beckoning to him
or only scrubbing the window. Then he entered the
woods where the ground was sparsely covered with pine-needles.</p>

<p>He had to stoop and search for the guiding mark and
there were places where for thirty or forty feet at
a stretch it was not visible, but the tumbled appearance
of the pine-needle carpet showed where someone had
recently passed. Then the marks took him into a beaten
way and he jogged along with hope mounting high.</p>

<p>He had tracked for more than twenty-five minutes and
a very skillful tracking it had been, entirely independent
of its possible result. So far as the tracking requirement
was concerned he had fulfilled that in good measure,
and the possible danger in connection with it would
commend it strongly to the Scout Commissioner. Moreover,
the deductive work which preceded the tracking and
the chivalrous motive would surely make up for any
lack in first aid and cooking. &#8220;One thing has
to make up for another,&#8221; he thought, recalling
Mr. Ellsworth&#8217;s words.</p>

<p>He was breathing hard, partly from a nervous fear
as to what he should do if he succeeded in overtaking
the robber, and his little celluloid membership booklet
with the precious bill in it, flapped against his
chest as he hurried on. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be in the
Second Class before Pee-wee,&#8221; he thought.</p>

<p>Suddenly he came to a dead stop as he saw a figure
sitting against the trunk of a tree a couple of hundred
feet away. The tree trunk was between himself and
the man and about all he could see was two knees drawn
up.</p>

<p>Now was the time for discretion. Tom was a husky enough
boy; he seemed much larger since he had acquired the
scout habit of standing straight, but he was not armed
and he felt certain that the stranger was.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I had Roy&#8217;s moccasins,&#8221;
he thought.</p>

<p>He retreated behind a tree himself and quietly removed
his shoes. The position of the stranger was favorable
for a stealthy approach and Tom advanced cautiously.
A flask lay beside the man and he was just taking
a measure of encouragement in the prospect of the man&#8217;s
being asleep when the drawn-up knees went down with
a sudden start and the figure rose spasmodically,
reeled slightly and clutched the tree.</p>

<p>Tom stepped back a pace, staring, for it was the face
of Bill Slade which was leering, half stupidly, at
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay&#8212;&#173;stay where you are,&#8221;
said Tom, his voice tense with fear and astonishment,
as his father made a step toward him. &#8220;I&#8212;&#173;I
tracked you-stay where you are&#8212;&#173;I&#8212;&#173;didn&#8217;
know who I wuz trackin&#8217;&#8212;&#173;I didn&#8217;.
Don&#8217;t you come no nearer. I&#8212;&#173;I wouldn&#8217;
do yer no hurt&#8212;&#173;I wouldn&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was curious how in his dismay and agitation he
fell into the old hoodlum phraseology and spoke to
his father just as he used to do when the greasy,
rickety dining-table was between them.</p>

<p>The elder Slade was a pathetic spectacle. He had gone
down quite as fast as his son had gone up. He leered
at the boy with red and heavy eyes out of a face which
had not been shaved in many a day. His cheek bones
protruded conspicuously. The coat which at the time
of Mrs. Slade&#8217;s funeral had been black and which
Tom remembered as a sort of grayish brown, was now
the color of newly rusted iron. His shoe, which had
turned traitor to him and whispered the direction of
his flight to the trailing scout, was tied with a
piece of cord. He was thin, even emaciated, and there
was a little twitch in his eye which grotesquely counterfeited
a wink, and which jarred Tom strangely. He did not
know whether it was his lately-acquired habit of observation
which made him notice this or whether it was a new
warning from Mother Nature to his father. But Tom
was not afraid of a man whose eye twitched like that.
He stood as firm as Roy Blakeley had stood that night
of his first meeting with him. That is what it means
to be a scout for two months.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yer&#8212;&#173;a&#8212;&#173;a one o&#8217;
them soldier lads, hey, Tommy?&#8221; said his father
unsteadily.</p>

<p>&#8220;You stay there,&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;Yer
seen what I d-did ter de marshal. I&#8217;m stronger
now than I wuz then, but I&#8217;m&#8212;&#173;I&#8217;m
gon&#8217;er be loyal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yer one o&#8217; them soldier fellers, hey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a scout of the Second Class,&#8221;
said Tom with a tremor in his voice: &#8220;or I would
be if &#8217;twasn&#8217;t for you. I&#8212;&#173;I
can&#8217;t tell &#8217;em the trackin&#8217; I done
<i>now</i>. I gotter obey the law.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yer wouldn&#8217; squeal on yer father, would
yer, Tommy?&#8221; said Slade, advancing with a suggestion
of menace. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217; want ter choke yer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom received this half-sneeringly, half-pityingly.
He felt that he could have stuck out his finger and
pushed his father over with it, so strong was he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gimme the pin yer took,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t care about nothin&#8217; else-but gimme
the pin yer took.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What pin?&#8221; grumbled Slade.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know what pin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yer think I&#8217;d steal?&#8221; his father
menaced.</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>know</i> yer did an&#8217; I want
that pin.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a minute the elder Slade glared at his son with
a look of fury. He made a start toward him and Tom
stood just as Roy had stood, without a stir.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yer&#8217;d call me a thief, would yer&#8212;&#173;yer&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was as bad myself once,&#8221; said Tom,
pitying him. &#8220;I swiped her ball. Gimme the pin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Taint wuth nothin&#8217;,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gimme it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Slade made an exploration of his pockets as if he
could not imagine where such a thing could be. Then
he looked at Tom as if reconsidering the wisdom of
an assault; then off through the woods as if to determine
the chance for a quick &#8220;get away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yer wouldn&#8217; tell nobuddy yer met me,&#8221;
he whined.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;ll <i>never</i> tell&#8212;&#173;gimme
the pin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217; hev nothin&#8217; to eat fer
two days, Tommy, an&#8217; I&#8217;ve got me cramps
bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>The same old cramps which had furnished the excuse
for many an idle day! Tom knew those cramps too well
to be affected by them, but he saw, too, that his
father was a spent man; and he thought of what Mr.
Ellsworth had said, &#8220;There wasn&#8217;t any First
Bridgeboro Troop when he was a boy, Tom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217; never tell I seen yer,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217; never-<i>ever</i>
tell. It&#8217;s my blame that we wuz put out o&#8217;
Barrel Alley. It was you&#8212;&#173;it was you took
me&#8212;&#173;to the&#8212;&#173;circus.&#8221;</p>

<p>He remembered that one happy afternoon which he had
once, long ago, enjoyed at his father&#8217;s hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I know yer wuz hungry or you wouldn&#8217;
go in there in the daytime-&#8217;cause you&#8217;d
be a fool to do it. I&#8217;m not cryin&#8217; &#8217;cause
I&#8217;m&#8212;&#173;a-scared&#8212;&#173;I don&#8217;t
get scared so easy&#8212;&#173;now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fumbling at his brown scout shirt he brought forth
on its string the folding membership card of the Boy
Scouts of America, attached to which was Tom&#8217;s
precious crisp five-dollar bill in a little bag.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gimme the pin,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Yer kin
say yer sold it fer five dollars-like,&#8221; he choked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this it?&#8221; asked Slade, bringing it
forth as if by accident, and knowing perfectly well
that it was.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; said Tom, handing him the bill.
&#8220;It ain&#8217;t only becuz yer give me the pin,
but becuz yer hungry and becuz&#8212;&#173;yer took
me ter the circus.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was strange how that one thing his father had done
for him kept recurring to the boy now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yer better get away,&#8221; he warned. &#8220;Old
John sent automobiles out and telephoned a lot. Don&#8217;t&#8212;&#173;don&#8217;t
lose it,&#8221; he added, realizing the large amount
of the money. &#8220;If yer tied it &#8217;round yer
neck it &#8217;ud be safer.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood just where he was as his father reeled away,
watching him a little wistfully and doubtful as to
whether he was sufficiently impressed with the sum
he was carrying to be careful of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It &#8217;ud be safer if you tied it &#8217;round
yer neck,&#8221; he repeated as his father passed
among the trees with that sideways gait and half-limp
which bespeaks a prideless and broken character.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never tell &#8217;em of the tracking
I do&#8212;&#173;did,&#8221; he said, &#8220;so I won&#8217;t
pass on that; but even if I did I couldn&#8217;t pass,
&#8217;cause I haven&#8217;t got the money to put
in the bank&#8212;&#173;now.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had lost his great fortune and his cherished dream
in one fell swoop.</p>

<p>And this was the triumph of his tracking</p>


<br><br>
<h1><a name="#11">Chapter XI</a></h1>

<h2>R-R-R-evenge</h2>

<p>Tom Slade had not the moral courage to crown his splendid
triumph by going straightway and giving the pin to
Mary Temple. He could not overcome his fear of John
Temple and the awe of the palatial residence. You
see, he had not the legacy of refined breeding to draw
upon. The Scout movement had taken a big contract
in the making of Tom Slade, but Mr. Ellsworth (good
sport that he was) was never daunted. Tom did not
know how to go alone up to the luxurious veranda at
Five Oaks, ring the bell, face that stoical Japanese,
ask to see the pretty, beautifullydressed girl, and
restore her pin to her. He could have done it without
revealing the identity of the fugitive, but he did
not know how to do it; he would not ask Roy to come
to his assistance, and he missed the best fruits of
his triumph.</p>

<p>So he went back to camp (scout pace, for it was getting
late), his empty membership booklet flapping against
his chest as he ran.</p>

<p>It was fortunate for his disturbed and rather sullen
state of mind that an unusual diversion was on the
boards at camp. The Ravens&#8217; tent was quite deserted;
Mr. Ellsworth was in his own tent, busily writing,
and he called out cordially, &#8220;Hello, Tommy,&#8221;
as Tom passed on to the Silver Foxes&#8217; tent.</p>

<p>Within Roy was standing on a box holding forth to
the entire patrol, and he was in that mood which never
failed to fascinate Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down; you get two slaps on the wrist for
being late,&#8221; said he. This was the only reference
he or any of them made to Tom&#8217;s disappearance
at Five Oaks. A scout is tactful. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
see any seat,&#8221; Tom said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get up and give Tom a seat,&#8221; ordered
Roy.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> wouldn&#8217;t get up and give
President Wilson a seat,&#8221; announced Eddie Ingram.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not me,&#8221; laughed Dorry Benton, &#8220;I
stalked for six miles to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get up and give Mr. Thomas Slade a seat, somebody,&#8221;
shouted Roy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep still, you&#8217;ll wake the baby,&#8221;
said Westy.</p>

<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t catch me getting up to give
George Washington a seat,&#8221; said Bert Collins,
&#8220;not after that hike.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make them get up,&#8221; said Roy,
fumbling in his pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you will&#8212;&#173;<i>not</i>,&#8221;
said Westy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at Eddie, he&#8217;s half asleep,&#8221;
said Dorry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wake up, Ed,&#8221; shouted Roy. &#8220;It&#8217;s
time to take your sleeping powder.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t get up if you set a firecracker
off under me, that&#8217;s how tired I am,&#8221;
mumbled Eddie.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make them get up,&#8221; Roy whispered,
winking at Tom.</p>

<p>He pulled out his trusty harmonica and began to play
the national air. Tom could not help laughing to see
how they all rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now&#8217;s your chance, sit down, Tom,&#8221;
said Roy. &#8220;The Pied Piper of What&#8217;s-his-name
hasn&#8217;t got anything on me! The object of the
puzzle, ladies and gentlemen,&#8221; he continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hear! Hear!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go to it. You&#8217;re doing fine!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The object of the puzzle,&#8221; said Roy,
rolling up his sleeves as if he intended to do the
puzzle then and there, &#8220;the object of the puzzle
is to get inside the Ravens&#8217; tent without entering
it. Will some gentleman in the audience kindly loan
me a high hat and a ten-dollar gold piece? No? Evidently
no gentleman in the audience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cut it out,&#8221; said Westy. &#8220;They&#8217;ll
be back in an hour. What are we going to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are not going to do anything until the silent
hour of midnight,&#8221; said Roy. &#8220;Then we
are going to make reprisals.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you make those?&#8221; called Westy.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s some word, all right,&#8221; said
Ed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tracked that all the way through the Standard
Dictionary,&#8221; said Roy.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about Mr. Ellsworth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has announced his policy of strict neutrality,&#8221;
said Roy. &#8220;The field is ours! The obnoxious
post-card will be ours if you, brave scouts, will
do your part! For one month now has that obnoxious
post-card hung in the Ravens&#8217; tent. For one
month has Pee-wee Harris smiled his smile and gone
unshaved&#8212;&#173;I mean unscathed. Shall this go
on?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! No!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall it be said that the Silver Foxes are
not Sterling silver but only German silver?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall the silver of the Silver Foxes be tarnished
by that slanderous card?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They have called us the &#8217;Follow Afters&#8217;&#8212;&#173;they
have said that we are nothing but &#8216;Silver <i>Polish</i>&#8217;&#8221;!</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll rub it into them,&#8221; shouted
Westy.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have taken cowardly refuge in the troop
rule that no Silver Fox shall enter their tent except
on invitation, and this insertion&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean aspersion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Glares forth from the upright of their sordid
lair&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Sordid lair&#8217; is good!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No extra charge,&#8221; said Roy; &#8220;until
now the worm has turned. If we cannot enter their
tent then we must take down their tent, remove the
card, and put the tent up again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, joy!&#8221; said Ed.</p>

<p>&#8220;And it must not be done sneakingly in their
absence, but to the soft music of their snoring. The
enterprise is beset with many dangers. Those who are
not willing to venture (as What-do-you-call-him said
when he stormed Fort Something-or-other) may stay
behind!&#8221;</p>

<p>Before camp-fire yarns, an elaborate card was prepared
in the privacy of the Silver Foxes&#8217; tent in
Roy&#8217;s characteristically glaring style, on which
appeared the single word, STUNG!</p>

<p>The night for this bold deed had been well chosen.
The Ravens had been stalking all day and at camp fire
Tom listened wistfully to the account of the day&#8217;s
most notable stunt which was Pee-wee&#8217;s tracking
of a muskrat more than half a mile within the required
twenty-five minutes of the Second Class provision.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pee-wee&#8217;ll be the first to jump out of
the Tenderfoot Class this summer,&#8221; said Mr.
Ellsworth, as he poked the crackling fire. &#8220;You
Silver Foxes will have to get busy.&#8221; He looked
pleasantly at Tom. &#8220;Hey, Tommy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was wondering,&#8221; said Roy, as he stretched
himself on the ground close to the cheerful blaze,
&#8220;if we couldn&#8217;t work in something special
for next Wednesday&#8212;&#173;it&#8217;s troop birthday.
We&#8217;ll be two years old.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, so it is,&#8221; said Artie
Van Arlen, Raven. &#8220;I&#8217;m a charter member;
the Silver Foxes weren&#8217;t even heard of or thought
of at that time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, they&#8217;re a lot of upstarts,&#8221;
said Doc. Carson, the first-aid boy. &#8220;You&#8217;d
think to hear them talk that they started before National
Headquarters did. I remember when this troop was a
one-ring circus: just us Ravens, and we had some good
times too. I had my first-aid badge before those triple-plated
Silver Foxes were born!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They have no traditions,&#8221; said the Ravens&#8217;
patrol leader.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re an up-to-date patrol, though,&#8221;
said Roy. &#8220;The Ravens are passe&#8212;&#173;like
the old Handbook. That kind of patrol was all right
when the thing first started; the Silver Foxes are
a last year&#8217;s model.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; laughed Mr. Ellsworth, raking
up the fire and drawing his grocery-box seat closer,
&#8220;maybe the Silver Foxes will be ancient history
soon. I&#8217;m thinking of a new pack of upstarts
for you foxes to make fun of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t made another flank move on
Connie Bennett, have you?&#8221; laughed Roy. They
were all familiar with Mr. Ellsworth&#8217;s dream
of another patrol.</p>

<p>&#8220;Connie rests his head on a pine cushion and
imagines he&#8217;s a Boy Scout,&#8221; said Artie.</p>

<p>&#8220;He blows the dust off a <i>Dan Dreadnought</i>
book and imagines it&#8217;s the wind howling through
the forest,&#8221; said Westy.</p>

<p>&#8220;He runs the tennis-marker over the lawn and
thinks he&#8217;s tracking,&#8221; said Pee-wee.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not as bad as that, boys,&#8221; laughed
the scoutmaster. &#8220;Between you and me and the
camp fire, I suspect Connie&#8217;s got the bug.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t given up hope yet?&#8221; said
Roy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never say die,&#8221; answered Mr. Ellsworth,
good-naturedly.</p>

<p>Once, twice, thrice had he made a daring assault on
the Bennett stronghold and once, twice, thrice had
he been gallantly repulsed by the Bennett right wing,
which was Mrs. Bennett. He had planted the Bennett
veranda with mines in the form of <i>Boys&#8217;
Life</i> and <i>Scouting,</i> but all to no
avail. Yet his hopeful spirit in regard to the visionary
Elk Patrol was almost pathetic.</p>

<p>The tent of the venerable Raven patrol was pitched
under a spreading tree and they retired with their
proud and ancient traditions, blissfully unaware of
the startling liberty which was to be taken with their
historic dignity by those upstart Silver Foxes. Mr.
Ellsworth, with a commendable application of his policy
of strict neutrality, retired to his own tent to dream
of the new patrol.</p>

<p>Never in the history of the troop had a Silver Fox
trespassed unknown into the ancient privacy of the
Ravens, and never had a Raven condescended to enter
the Silver Fox stronghold save honorably and by invitation.
They knew the Silver Foxes for a sportive crew pervaded
by the inventive spirit of Roy Blakeley, but they
had no fear of any violation of scout honor and the
obnoxious card hung ostentatiously on the central
upright of their tent.</p>

<p>In the still hour of midnight the enterprising Silver
Foxes emerged in spectral silence from their lair
and the battle-cry (or rather, whisper) was &#8220;Revenge,&#8221;
pronounced by Roy as if it had a dozen rattling R&#8217;s
at the beginning of it. Every boy was keyed to the
highest pitch of excitement.</p>

<p>The Ravens&#8217; tent was a makeshift affair of their
own manufacture and when its sides were not up it
was more of a pavilion than a tent: the Ravens believed
in fresh air. There were two forked uprights and across
these was laid the ridgepole. The canvas was spread
over this and drawn diagonally toward the ground on
either side. There were front and back and sides for
stormy weather but they were seldom in requisition.</p>

<p>The program, discussed and settled beforehand, was
carried out in scout silence, which is about thirty-three
and one-third per cent greater than the regular market
silence. Tom and Eddie Ingram, being the tallest of
the foxes, stationed themselves at either upright,
the other members of the patrol lining up along the
sides where they loosened the ropes from the pegs.
Then Tom and Ed lifted the ridgepole, the scouts along
the sides held the canvas high, and the entire patrol
moved uniformly and in absolute silence. The tent,
intact, was moved from over the sleeping Ravens as
the magic carpet of the <i>Arabian Nights</i>
was moved. It was a very neat little piece of work
and showed with what precision the patrol could act
in concert. Thanks partly to their strenuous day of
stalking, never a Raven stirred except Doc. Carson,
who startled them by turning over.</p>

<p>In the centre of the Ravens&#8217; tent a sapling
had been planted, its branches cut away to within
several inches of its trunk, so that it made a very
passable clothes-tree. This still stood, like a ghostly
sentinel, among the slumbering Ravens, laden with their
clothes and paraphernalia. The sudden and radical
transformation of the scene was quite grotesque and
the unsheltered household gods of the Ravens looked
ludicrous enough as they lay about in homelike disposition
with nothing above them but the stars.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great!&#8221; whispered Roy, gleefully.</p>

<p>Eddie Ingram laid his end of the ridgepole on the
ground and stealing cautiously over among the sleeping
Ravens, removed the post card from the sapling and
put the other card in its place. Then, stealing back
to where the others were waiting, he resumed his end
of the pole. This was restored to its place in the
forked uprights, the ropes were fastened to the pegs
along either side and the Silver Foxes bore Esther
Blakeley&#8217;s memento of their own disgrace triumphantly
to their stronghold.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you beat it?&#8221; said Roy, releasing
himself with a sense of refreshment from the imposition
of silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;A scout is stealthy,&#8221; remarked Westy.</p>

<p>In the morning Pee-wee sauntered over and paused outside
the Silver Foxes&#8217; tent, not saying a word, though.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Roy, &#8220;what can we do
for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see you&#8217;ve got the card,&#8221; said
Pee-wee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Westy, pulling on his blouse.
&#8220;We&#8217;re going to frame it and send it to
National Headquarters, too, for an exhibition of scout
stealth and silence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you think we walked in and took it,&#8221;
said Roy, adjusting his belt. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t.
We never entered your tent. A scout is honorable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Pee-wee, &#8220;you took the
tent down and put it up wrong end to. A scout is observant.
Are we going fishing to-day?&#8221;</p>


<br><br>
<h1><a name="#12">Chapter XII</a></h1>

<p>&#8220;Up Against It for Fair&#8221;</p>

<p>When the telegraph and the telephone and the speeding
autos and the bullying of the hapless village constable
failed to reveal any clue to the burglar at Five Oaks,
John Temple proceeded to pooh-pooh the whole business
and say that there had never been any burglar, but
that in all probability the maid had been exploring
Mary&#8217;s trinkets just as Mrs. Temple returned
and that the &#8220;frightful-looking man&#8221; whom
she had met on the stairs was a myth.</p>

<p>It was then that the maid, groping for any straw in
her extremity, said that a boy in khaki had darted
out from the pantry and across the private rear lawn
into the woods beyond while she stood at the window.</p>

<p>If she had stuck to the plain truth and not permitted
Mr. Temple to beat her down as to the man she actually
did see on the stairs, a great deal of suffering might
have been saved. But the loss of only one trinket,
and that one of small intrinsic value, seemed to lend
color to the theory that it was the work of a boy
rather than of a professional adult burglar, and the
master of Five Oaks, thinking this matter worth inquiring
into, called up the constable and laid the thing before
him in this new light.</p>

<p>Mr. John Temple had no particular grudge against the
Boy Scouts. He was a rational, hard-headed business
man, decisive and practical and without much imagination.
His lack of imagination was, indeed, his main trouble.
He was not silly enough and he was extremely too busy
to bear any active malice toward an organization having
to do with boys, and except when the scouts were mentioned
to him he never gave them a thought one way or the
other. He was not the archenemy of the movement (as
some of the boys themselves thought): he simply had
no use for it.</p>

<p>So far as the scout idea had been explained to him
by the Bridgeboro Local Council (to whom he had granted
five minutes of his time) he thought it consisted
of a sort of poetical theory and that money put into
it was simply thrown away. He believed, and he told
the Council so, that ample provision had been made
for boys in the form of circuses and movie plays and
baseball games for good ones and reformatories and
prisons for bad ones, and he referred, as the successful
man is so apt to do, to his own poor boyhood and how
he had attended to business and done what was right
and so on, and so on, and so on.</p>

<p>Nor had this king of finance cherished any particular
resentment toward the poor creature who had thrown
a stone at him. John Temple was a big man and he was
not petty, but he was intensely practical, and he had
no patience with Mr. Ellsworth&#8217;s notions for
the making of good citizens. He had known two generations
of Slades; he had never known any of them to amount
to anything, and he believed that the proper place
for a hoodlum and a truant and an orphan was in an
institution. He paid his taxes for the support of
these institutions regularly and he believed they
ought to be used for what they were intended for. He
thought it was little less than criminal that the
son of Bill Slade should be wandering over the face
of the earth when he might be legally placed in a
dormitory, eating his three meals a day in a white-washed
corridor.</p>

<p>For Mr. Ellsworth, John Temple had only contempt.
He looked down upon him as the man without imagination
always looks down upon the man with imagination. Meanwhile
the new subtle spirit was working in Tom Slade and
the capitalist had neither the time nor the interest
to stoop and watch the wonderful transformation which
was going on.</p>

<p>He was not prompted by any feeling of spite or resentment
toward Tom and the scouts when he told the constable
about &#8220;young Slade.&#8221; He believed that
he was acting wisely and even in Tom&#8217;s best interests,
and it was in vain that his young daughter tried to
pull him away from the telephone. Mrs. Temple weepingly
implored him to remember the hospitality and the courtesy
which she and Mary had just enjoyed at the hands of
the scouts, but it was of no use. If no one had mentioned
Tom he would never have thought of him, but since
Mary had mentioned him he believed it was a good time
to have Mr. Ellsworth&#8217;s experiment with Tom
looked into before &#8220;all the houses in the neighborhood
were robbed.&#8221; He did not mean that, of course;
it was simply his way of talking.</p>

<p>It was the second morning after the Silver Foxes&#8217;
proud recovery of Esther Blakeley&#8217;s card that
a loose-jointed personage from Salmon River Village
sauntered into camp, his face screwed up as if he were
studying the sun, and surveyed the camp with that
frank and leisurely scrutiny which bespeaks the &#8220;Rube.&#8221;
Concealed beneath his coat he wore a badge which he
had fished out of an unused cooky-jar just before starting,
and it swelled his rural pride to feel the weight of
it on his suspender.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wha&#8217;ose boss here?&#8221; he asked Pee-wee,
who was about his customary duty of spearing loose
papers with a pointed stick.</p>

<p>&#8220;No boss,&#8221; said Pee-wee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wha&#8217;ose runnin&#8217; the shebang?&#8221;</p>

<p>Pee-wee pointed to Mr. Ellsworth&#8217;s little tent
just inside which the scoutmaster sat on an onion-crate
stool, writing.</p>

<p>The official personage sauntered over, watched by
several boys, paused to inspect the wireless apparatus
in its little leanto. His inquisitive manner was rather
jarring. By the time he reached Mr. Ellsworth&#8217;s
tent a little group had formed about him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ya&#8217;ou the boss here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-morning,&#8221; said Mr. Ellsworth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ya&#8217;ou the boss?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; the boys are boss; anything we can do for
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The stranger looked about curiously. &#8220;Got permission
t&#8217; camp here, I s&#8217;pose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the owner of the property,&#8221;
said Mr. Ellsworth, laughingly, indicating Roy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hmmm; ye got a young feller here by th&#8217;
name o&#8217; Slade?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what we have,&#8221; said the
scoutmaster with his usual breezy pleasantry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I reckon I&#8217;ll hev ter see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly; what for?&#8221; Mr. Ellsworth asked
rather more interested.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s got hisself into a leetle mite o&#8217;
trouble,&#8221; the stranger drawled; &#8220;leastways,
mebbe he has.&#8221; He seemed to enjoy being mysterious.</p>

<p>So Tom was called. Roy came with him, and all who
were in camp at the moment clustered about the scoutmaster&#8217;s
tent. Mr. Ellsworth&#8217;s manner was one of perfect
confidence in Tom and half-amusement at the stranger&#8217;s
relish of his own authority.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t wish to see him privately,
I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Na-o&#8212;&#173;leastways not &#8217;less he
does. Seems you was trespassing araound Five Oaks
t&#8217;other day,&#8221; he said to Tom in his exasperating
drawl, and with deliberate hesitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good heavens, man!&#8221; said Mr. Ellsworth,
nettled. &#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to tell me this
boy is charged with trespassing! Why, half a dozen
of these boys accompanied Mrs. Temple and her daughter
home&#8212;&#173;they were invited into the house.&#8221;
He looked at the stranger, half angry and half amused.
&#8220;Mrs. Temple and her daughter were our guests
here. We might as well say <i>they</i> were trespassing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Leastways they din&#8217;t take nuthin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221; said the scoutmaster,
sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye know a pin was missin&#8217; thar?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mr. Ellsworth, impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; one o&#8217; these youngsters was
seen sneakin&#8217;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; the scoutmaster jerked out;
&#8220;we don&#8217;t do any sneaking here. Be careful
how you talk. You are trespassing yourself, sir, if
it comes to that.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was never a moment in the troop&#8217;s history,
not even in that unpleasant scene in John Temple&#8217;s
vacant lot, when the boys so admired their scoutmaster.
His absolute confidence in every member of the troop
thrilled them with an incentive which no amount of
discipline could have inspired. It was plain to see
that they felt this&#8212;&#173;all save Tom, whose
face was a puzzle.</p>

<p>He stood there among them, his belt pulled unnecessarily
tight, after the fashion of the boy who has always
worn a suspender, the trim intent of the scout regalia
hardly showing to advantage on his rather clumsy form.
His puttees were never well adjusted; the khaki jacket
(when he wore it) had a perverse way of working up
in back. He presented a marked contrast to Roy&#8217;s
natty appearance and to Westy whose uniform fitted
him so perfectly that he seemed to have been poured
into it as a liquid into a mould. Both boys looked
every inch a scout. Yet there was something strangely
distinctive about Tom as he stood there. A discerning
person might have fancied his uncouthness as part and
parcel of a certain rugged quality which could not
be expressed in precise attire. There was something
ominous in the dogged, sullen look which his countenance
wore. He seemed a sort of law unto himself, having
a certain resource in himself and seeking now neither
advice nor assistance. He was no figure for the cover
of the Scout Handbook, yet he had drawn out of it
its full measure of strength; he would accept no one&#8217;s
interpretation of it but his own and thus he stood
among them and yet apart&#8212;&#173;as good a scout
as ever raised his hand to take the oath.</p>

<p>&#8220;One o&#8217; these youngsters went daown stairs
and raound the haouse t&#8217; th&#8217; pantry &#8216;n&#8217;
he was seen to go without warrant of law crost Temple&#8217;s
lawn and inter his private woods.&#8221; The man had
his little spats of legal phraseology, of course,
and Mr. Ellsworth could almost have murdered him for
his &#8220;without warrant of law.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any one of you boys go &#8217;without warrant
of law&#8217;?&#8221; asked the scoutmaster, with
an air of humorous disgust.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; said Tom simply.</p>

<p>The scoutmaster looked at him in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;What for, Tom?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got nothing to say,&#8221; said
Tom.</p>

<p>Doc. Carson, who was of all things observant, noticed
a set appearance about Tom&#8217;s jaw and a far-away
look in his eyes as if he neither knew nor cared about
any of those present.</p>

<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose if we was to search ye we wouldn&#8217;t
find nothin&#8217; on ye t&#8217; shouldn&#8217;t
be thar?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a scout of the sec&#8212;&#173;I am a scout,&#8221;
said Tom, impassively. &#8220;No one will search me.&#8221;</p>

<p>It would be hard to describe the look in Mr. Ellsworth&#8217;s
eyes as he watched Tom. There was confidence, there
was admiration, but withal an almost pathetic look
of apprehension and suspense. He studied Tom as a
pilot fixes his gaze intently upon a rocky shore. Tom
did not look at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye wouldn&#8217;t relish bein&#8217; searched,
I reckon?&#8221; the constable said with an exasperating
grin of triumph.</p>

<p>Then the thunderbolt fell. Calmly Tom reached down
into his pocket and brought forth the little class
pin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what you want,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t know first off, but now I know. You couldn&#8217;t
search me&#8212;&#173;I wouldn&#8217; leave&#8212;&#173;let
you. I could handle a marshal, and I&#8217;m stronger
now than I was then. But you can&#8217;t search me;
you can&#8217;t disgrace my patrol by searchin&#8217;
them&#8212;&#173;or by searchin&#8217; me &#8212;&#173;&#8217;cause
I wouldn&#8217;t lea&#8212;&#173;let you. <i>Get away</i>
from me!&#8221; with such frantic suddenness that
they started. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you try to take it
from me! I&#8217;m a scout of&#8212;&#173;I&#8217;m
a scout&#8212;&#173;mind! Where&#8217;s Roy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom,&#8221; said Mr. Ellsworth, his voice tense
with emotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Roy?&#8221; the boy asked, ignoring
him.</p>

<p>Roy stepped forward as he had done once before when
Tom was in trouble, and they made an odd contrast.
&#8220;Here, Tom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You take it an&#8217; give it to Mary Temple
and tell her it&#8217;s tossin&#8217; it back&#8212;&#173;kind
of. She&#8217;ll know what I mean. You know how to
go to places like that&#8212;&#173;but they get me
scared. Tell her it&#8217;s instead of the rubber
ball, and that I sent it to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Tom,&#8221; said Mr. Ellsworth, his voice
almost breaking, &#8220;is that all you have to say&#8212;&#173;Tom?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a scout&#8212;&#173;I&#8217;m obeyin&#8217;
the law&#8212;&#173;that&#8217;s all,&#8221; said Tom,
doggedly. He seemed to be the only one of them all
who was not affected, so sure did he feel of himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I have to get arrested?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye-es, I reckon I&#8217;ll hev to take ye &#8217;long,&#8221;
said the constable, advancing.</p>

<p>Tom never flinched.</p>

<p>Roy tried to speak but could only say, &#8220;Tom&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Ellsworth put his palm to his forehead and held
it there a moment as if his head throbbed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I have my book?&#8221; Tom asked as the
constable, taking his arm, took a step away.</p>

<p>It was Pee-wee who glided, scout pace, over to the
Silver Foxes&#8217; tent. In the unusual situation
it never occurred to him that he, a Raven, was entering
it uninvited. Esther Blakeley&#8217;s triumphant post
card hung there but he never noticed it. He brought
the well-thumbed Handbook with T. S. on it, and it
was curious to see that he gave it to Roy instead
of to Tom.</p>

<p>But Tom noticed his bringing it. &#8220;I&#8217;m
glad you did your tracking stunt, Pee-wee,&#8221;
he said, with just a little quiver in his voice.</p>

<p>Roy handed him the book. Then, just as they started
off, Mr. Ellsworth, gathering himself together as
one coming out of a trance, accosted the departing
constable.</p>

<p>&#8220;This boy was placed in my charge by the court
in Bridgeboro,&#8221; said he, holding the man off.</p>

<p>&#8220;That don&#8217;t make no difference,&#8221;
drawled the man. &#8220;I got a right to go anywheres
for a fugitive or a suspect. A guardian writ wouldn&#8217;t
be no use to ye in a criminal charge.&#8221; And he
smiled as if he were perfectly willing to explain
the law for the benefit of the uninitiated.</p>

<p>Tom, clutching his Handbook, walked along at the man&#8217;s
side. He seemed utterly indifferent to what was happening.</p>

<p>There were no camp-fire yarns that night.</p>


<br><br>
<h1><a name="#13">Chapter XIII</a></h1>

<h2>He Who Has Eyes to See</h2>

<p>Mr. Ellsworth did not respond to the call for supper
that evening and Artie, who was cookee for the week,
did not go to his tent a second time. The two patrols
ate at the long board under a big elm tree; Tom&#8217;s
vacant place was conspicuous, but very little was said
about the affair. It was noticeable that the Ravens
made no mention of it out of respect to the other
patrol.</p>

<p>After supper Roy went alone to Mr. Ellsworth&#8217;s
tent. There was a certain freedom of intimacy between
these two, partly, no doubt, because Roy&#8217;s father
was on the Local Council. The scoutmaster had no favorites
and the close relation between himself and Roy was
not generally apparent in the troop. It was simply
that Roy indulged in a certain privilege of intercourse
which Mr. Ellsworth&#8217;s cordial relations at the
Blakeley home seemed to encourage, and I dare say
Roy&#8217;s own buoyant and charmingly aggressive nature
had a good deal to do with it. He also (though in
quite another way than Tom) seemed a law unto himself.</p>

<p>Arranging himself with drawn up knees upon the scoutmaster&#8217;s
cot, he began without any introduction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you notice, Chief&#8221; (he often called
the scoutmaster chief) &#8220;how he kept saying,
&#8217;I am a scout&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I did,&#8221; said Mr. Ellsworth, wearily.
&#8220;It&#8217;s the one ray of hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you notice how he said he was obeying the
law?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he did; I had forgotten that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His wanting the Handbook, too,&#8221; said
Mr. Ellsworth, quietly, &#8220;had a certain ring
to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever take a squint at that Handbook
of his, Chief?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Mr. Ellsworth, smiling wanly;
&#8220;I&#8217;m not as observant as you, Roy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has simply worn it out&#8212;&#173;it&#8217;s
a sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His mind is not complex,&#8221; said Mr. Ellsworth,
half-heartedly, &#8220;yet he&#8217;s a mystery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything is literal to Tom, Chief; he sees
only two colors, black and white.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was another pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you eat a little something,
Chief?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not to-night, Roy. I can&#8217;t. If that
thing is true&#8212;&#173;if there&#8217;s no explanation,
why, then my whole structure falls down; and John Temple
is right.&#8221; His voice almost broke. &#8220;Tom
is either no scout at all or else&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or else he&#8217;s about the best scout that
lives,&#8221; interrupted Roy. &#8220;Will you ever
forget how he looked as he stood there? Hanged if I
can! I&#8217;ve seen pictures enough of scouts&#8212;&#173;waving
flags and doing good turns and holding staves and
looking like trim little soldiers&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like you, Roy,&#8221; smiled Mr. Ellsworth.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I never saw anything like that! Did you
notice his mouth? His&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said Mr. Ellsworth, &#8220;he
looked like a martyr.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whenever you see a picture of a scout,&#8221;
said Roy, &#8220;it always shows what a scout can
do with his hands and feet; he&#8217;s tracking or
signalling or something like that. <i>There</i>
was a picture that shows the other side of it. You
never see those pictures in the books. Cracky, but
I&#8217;d like to have gotten a snap-shot of him just
as he stood there with his mouth set like the jaws
of a trap, his eyes ten miles away and his hand clutching
that battered old Handbook.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you dropped in, Roy, it cheers
me up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m a good scout,&#8221; laughed
Roy. &#8220;I&#8217;m not thinking about you; I&#8217;m
selfish. I&#8217;m the one that hauled Tom across,
you know, and I&#8217;ve got <i>my</i> reputation
to look after. That&#8217;s all <i>I</i> care
about.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Ellsworth smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to dig out the truth about
this between now and to-morrow morning. I may have
to trespass even, but <i>I</i> should worry. What
are <i>you</i> going to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing to-night. In the morning I&#8217;ll
see Mr. Temple and also Tom, and see if I can&#8217;t
get him to talk. What else <i>can</i> I do? What
are you going to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I decline to be interviewed,&#8221; Roy laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t you get into any trouble,
Roy.&#8221;</p>

<p>After the boy had gone, Mr. Ellsworth picked up his
own copy of the <i>Handbook for Boys</i>, and
looked with a wistful smile at the picturesque, natty
youngster on the cover, holding the red flags. It
always reminded him of Roy.</p>

<p>Roy was satisfied that the only hope of learning anything
was to visit the scene of Tom&#8217;s suspicious,
or at least unexplained, departure from the Temple
house. About this he knew no more than what the constable
had said, but he firmly believed that whatever Tom
had done and wherever he had gone, it had been for
a purpose. He did not believe that Tom had taken the
pin, but he felt certain that if he <i>had</i>
been tempted to, he (Roy) would have seen him do so.
For a scout is not only loyal, he is watchful. His
confidence in Tom, no less than his confidence in
himself, made him morally certain that his friend was
innocent; and Tom&#8217;s own demeanor at the time
of his arrest made him doubly certain.</p>

<p>A little before dark, Roy put on his Indian moccasins,
took his pocket flashlight and a good stock of matches,
and started for Five Oaks. Reaching there, he made
sure the veranda was deserted (for which fact he had
to thank the chill air) and found it easy to trace
Tom&#8217;s footprints around to the back of the house
through the almost bare earth of the new lawn.</p>

<p>In the little recess by the pantry window he felt
more secure. The play of his flashlight quickly discovered
the painty smear on the windowsill and he examined
it closely, as Tom had recently done, but Roy&#8217;s
mental alertness saved him time and trouble. Instead
of trying to pick out footprints across the back lawn,
he hurried across it, ran along to the end of the
fence, and then back again, closely watching the upper
rail by the aid of his light. Sure enough, there was
a faint smootch of paint and by this easy discovery
he had saved himself several hundred feet of difficult
tracking. Better still, his own suspicions and the
servants&#8217; original story were confirmed.</p>

<p>Tom might have gone around the house, but <i>someone
else had climbed through the pantry window</i>.</p>

<p>For a while Roy and his trusty ally, the pocket flashlight,
had a pretty rough tussle of it with the secretive
floor of pine-needles in the woods beyond the fence;
but Tom&#8217;s own uncertain pauses and turnings
and kneelings helped him, and he was thankful that
his predecessor had left these signs of his own movements
to guide him. For he now felt certain that Tom had
passed here in the wake of someone else.</p>

<p>It was a long time before he found himself in the
beaten path, having covered a distance of perhaps
an eighth of a mile where his tracking had been, as
he later said himself, like hunting for a pin on a
carpet in the dark. He had been on his hands and knees
most of the time, shooting his light this way and
that, moving the pine-needles carefully away from
some fancied indentation, with almost a watchmaker&#8217;s
delicacy of touch. It was not so much tracking as
it was the working out of a puzzle, but it brought
him at last into the path and then he found something
which rendered further tracking unnecessary. This was
the flask which had lain beside Tom&#8217;s father.</p>

<p>And now Roy, with no human presence to distract him
as Tom had had, noticed something lying near the flask
which Tom had not seen. This was a little scrap of
pasteboard which had evidently been the corner of a
ticket, and holding his flashlight to it he examined
it carefully. There was the termination of a sentence,
&#8220;...ers&#8217; Union,&#8221; and the last letters
of a name, &#8220;...ade,&#8221; which had been written
with ink on a printed line.</p>

<p>It meant nothing to him except as the slightest thing
means something to a scout, but he began searching
diligently for more of the torn fragments of this
card. The breeze had been there before him and he had
crept on hands and knees many feet in every direction
before his search was rewarded by enough of these
scattered scraps to enlighten him. But the light which
they shed was like a searchlight!</p>

<p>Using his membership card for a background and some
pine gum to stick the fragments to it, he succeeded
in restoring enough of the card to learn that it was
a membership card of the Bricklayers&#8217; Union belonging
to one William Slade.</p>

<p>Then, all of a sudden, he caught the whole truth and
understood what had happened.</p>


<br><br>
<h1><a name="14">Chapter XIV</a></h1>

<h2>Roy to the Rescue</h2>

<p>It was late when Roy reached camp and he spoke to
no one. Early in the morning he repaired to Five Oaks
to &#8220;beard the lion in his den&#8221; and have
a personal interview with Mr. John Temple.</p>

<p>There was nothing about Mr. Temple or his house which
awed Roy in the least. He had been reared in a home
of wealth and that atmosphere which poor Tom could
not overcome his fear of did not trouble Roy at all.
He was as much at ease in the presence of his elders
as it is possible for a boy to be without disrespect,
but he was now to be put to the test.</p>

<p>He found Mr. Temple enjoying an after-breakfast smoke
on the wide veranda at Five Oaks, a bag of golf sticks
beside him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, Mr. Temple,&#8221; said Roy.</p>

<p>If one had to encounter Mr. John Temple at all, this
was undoubtedly the best time and place to do it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, sir,&#8221; said he, brusquely
but not unpleasantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess maybe you know me, Mr. Temple; I&#8217;m
Mr. Blakeley&#8217;s boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Temple nodded. Roy leaned against the rubble-stone
coping of the veranda.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Temple,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I came to
see you about something. At first I was going to ask
Mr. Ellsworth to do it, then I decided I would do it
myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Temple worked his cigar over to the corner of
his mouth, looking at Roy curiously and not without
a touch of amusement. What he saw was a trim, sun-browned
boy wrestling with a charming little touch of diffidence,
trying to decide how to proceed in this matter which
was so important to him and so trifling to John Temple,
but exhibiting withal the inherent self-possession
which bespeaks good breeding. He was half sitting
on the coping and half leaning against it, his browned,
muscular arms pressing it on either side.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the incongruity of the encounter, or
perhaps his recent breakfast and his good cigar, but
he said not unpleasantly, &#8220;Lift yourself up
there and sit down if you want to. What can I do for
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Roy lifted himself up on the coping and swung his
legs from it and felt at home.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about Tom Slade, Mr. Temple. I know
you don&#8217;t like him and haven&#8217;t much use
for any of us scouts, and I was afraid if Mr. Ellsworth
came to see you there might be an argument or something
like that, but there couldn&#8217;t be one with me
because I&#8217;m only a kid and I don&#8217;t know
how to argue. But there&#8217;s another reason too;
I stood for Tom&#8212;&#173;brought him into the troop&#8212;&#173;and
he&#8217;s my friend and whatever is done for him
<i>I</i> want to do it. I&#8217;ll tell you what
he did&#8212;&#173;you know, he&#8217;s changed an
awful lot since you knew him. I don&#8217;t say a
fellow would always change so much but <i>he&#8217;s</i>
changed an awful lot. You&#8217;d hardly believe what
I&#8217;m going to tell you if you didn&#8217;t know
about his changing. It was his own father, Mr. Temple,
that took Mary&#8217;s pin&#8212;&#173;it wasn&#8217;t
Tom. I&#8217;m dead sure of it, and I&#8217;ll tell
you how I know.</p>

<center>
<img alt="illus6.jpg (94K)" src="illus6.jpg" height="541" width="836">
<br />
&#8220;Sometimes a fellow is afraid of a girl.&#8221;
</center>
<br><br />

<p>&#8220;I think he went out of the room where the rest
of us were that day because he was afraid he might
see you&#8212;&#173;ashamed, you know&#8212;&#173;kind
of. I&#8217;d have felt the same way if I had thrown
stones at you. Well, he went around the house&#8212;&#173;I
don&#8217;t know just why he did that&#8212;&#173;but
anyway, he found tracks there and he found a paint
smudge on the window-ledge where the burglar climbed
out. There&#8217;s another smudge on the fence where
the burglar got over. Tom tracked him and found it
was his own father and he got the pin from him, but
I suppose maybe he was afraid to come and give it
to Mary. You know, sometimes a fellow is afraid of
a girl&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>John Temple smiled slightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And he was afraid of you, too, I suppose, and
that&#8217;s where he fell down, keeping the pin in
his pocket. I know it was his father because-here.
I&#8217;ll show you, Mr. Temple. Here&#8217;s his membership
card in a union with his name on it, and this is what
I think. He stopped in the woods and tore this up
so there wouldn&#8217;t be anything on him to show
his name and that was just when Tom found him. Tom
wouldn&#8217;t tell about it because it&#8217;s one
of our laws that a scout must be loyal. So I want to
give this pin to Mary and then I want Tom to go back
with me because it&#8217;s our troop birthday pretty
soon&#8212;&#173;we&#8217;ve been going two years and&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come around and show me your smudge and your
tracks,&#8221; said Mr. Temple. &#8220;If what you
say is true you can go down in the car with me and
I&#8217;ll withdraw the complaint and do what I can
to have the matter expedited. You might let me have
the pin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t I give it to Mary?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, if she&#8217;s about.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was there in the spacious veranda that Roy handed
Mary the pin and told her exactly what Tom had asked
him to say.</p>

<p>The chauffeur who saw Mr. Temple step into the touring
car followed by Roy, carrying the golf sticks, was
a little puzzled. He was still more puzzled to hear
his master making inquiries about tracking. After they
had gone a few hundred yards he was ordered to stop
and then he saw Roy run back to the house and return
with two more golf sticks which his master had forgotten.</p>

<p>If John Temple had had the least recollection of that
scene in his own vacant lot in Bridgeboro, he might
have recalled the prophetic words of Mr. Ellsworth,
&#8220;<i>by our fruits shall you know us, Mr. Temple</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Doubtless, he had forgotten that incident. The tracking
business, however, interested him; he was by no means
convinced, but he was sufficiently persuaded to say
the word which would free Tom. Roy&#8217;s assumption
of full responsibility in regard to the golf sticks
amused him, and Roy&#8217;s general behaviour pleased
him more than he allowed Roy to know.</p>

<p>He had no particular interest in the scouts, but away
down in the heart of John Temple was a wish for something
which he could not procure with his check-book, and
that was a son. A son like Roy would not be half bad.
He rather liked the way the boy had sat on the coping
and swung his legs.</p>


<br><br>
<h1><a name="15">Chapter XV</a></h1>

<h2>Lemonade and Olives</h2>

<p>It fell out that on one of those fair August days
there came out from Bridgeboro a picnic party of people
who were forced to take their nature by the day, and
following in the wake of these, as the peanutman follows
the circus, there came that trusty rear-guard of all
such festive migrations,&#8212;&#173;Slats Corbett,
the &#8220;Two aces&#8221; (Jim and Jakie Mattenburg),
two of the three O&#8217;Connor boys (the other one
had mumps), and, yea, even Sweet Caporal himself.</p>

<p>The petrified mud of Bridgeboro was upon their clothes,
the dust of it was in the corners of their unwashed
eyes. They wore no badges but if they had these should
have shown a leaden goat superimposed upon a tomato
can, with a tobacco-label ribbon, so suggestive were
they of street corners and vacant lots and ash heaps.</p>

<p>It was a singular freak of fate that the destiny of
the carefullynurtured Connover Bennett should have
been involved with this gallant crew.</p>

<p>The picnic was conducted according to the time-honored
formula of such festivities. There were lemonade and
cold coffee in milk bottles; there were sandwiches
in shoe boxes; there were hard-boiled eggs with accompanying
salt in little twists of brown paper; there were olives
and hat-pins to extract them with, and there were camel&#8217;s
hair shawls to &#8220;spread on the damp ground.&#8221;</p>

<p>The rear-guard did not participate in the sumptuous
feast. &#8220;A life on the ocean wave&#8221; was
what they sought, and their investigations of the
wooded neighborhood had not gone very far when they
made discovery of an object which of all things is
dear to the heart of a city boy, and that was a boat.</p>

<p>It was pulled up along the river bank near the picnic
grounds, and as a matter of fact, belonged to the
scouts. It was used by them in crossing the river
to make a short-cut to and from Salmon River Village,
instead of following the shore to a point opposite
the town where there was a bridge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Findings is keepings&#8221; is the first law
of the hoodlum code, and though the O&#8217;Connor
boys hung back (partly because they had no right to
the boat and more because they were afraid of the
water), Sweet Caporal, who balked at nothing save
a policeman, led the rest of his intrepid band to
the boat and presently they were flopping clumsily
about in midstream, much to the amusement of the O&#8217;Connor
boys and several of the picnickers who clustered at
the shore.</p>

<p>There are few sights more ridiculous than the ignorant
handling of a boat. Sweet Caporal wielded an oar,
Slats Corbett wrestled with another one, Jakie Mattenburg
gallantly manned the helm, invariably pulling the
tiller-lines the wrong way, while Jim Mattenburg, with
a broken and detached thwart, did his best to counteract
every effort of his companions. Amid these conflicting
activities the boat made no progress and the ineffectual
splashing and the contradictory orders which were
shouted by the several members of the gallant crew
were greeted with derisive hoots from the shore.</p>

<p>Several times an oar slipped its lock and went splashing
into the water; once Sweet Caporal himself was capsized
by the catching of the unwieldy oar in its lock and
tumbled ingloriously backward into the bottom of the
boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pull on the left one!&#8221; shouted Jim.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nah, pull on de odder one!&#8221; cried Slats.</p>

<p>&#8220;Both pull together,&#8221; sagely suggested
someone on the shore, but that was quite impossible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold de rudder in de middle&#8217;, yer gump!&#8221;
shouted Sweet Caporal.</p>

<p>&#8220;If yer want de boat to go to de right, pull
on de left rope,&#8221; shouted Jim.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, de right one,&#8221; corrected Sweet Caporal.</p>

<p>So Jakie Mattenburg took a chance with the right rope
and whatever good effect that might have had was immediately
counteracted by his brother who paddled frantically
on the left side with his broken thwart until he lost
it in the water.</p>

<p>This loss might have helped matters some if Jakie
had not unshipped the rudder altogether, and hauled
it aboard like a rebellious fish, by the long tiller-lines.</p>

<p>&#8220;Both sit on de same seat,&#8221; commanded
Sweet Caporal, and Slats and Slats Corbett took his
place alongside him, while the boat rocked perilously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, both pull together!&#8221; called one
of the laughing watchers.</p>

<p>So they pulled together with such a frantic stroke
that one of the oarlocks was lifted from its socket
and dropped into the water. The sudden dislodgment
of the oar precipitated Slats against one of the Mattenburg
boys who thereupon announced that he would man the
oar instead. While he was taking his place Sweet Caporal
continued to pull frantically, the oar sliding back
in its lock and the boat going around in a circle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put dat rudder on,&#8221; commanded Sweet Caporal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t find no place it fits inter,&#8221;
said Jakie, reaching under the water at the stern.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, paddle wid it, den,&#8221; said Slats.</p>

<p>So Jakie, grasping the rudder by its neck, proceeded
to paddle with it off one side until the cross-bar
broke and the lines got into a hopeless tangle with
his arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did I tell yer?&#8221; shouted Slats.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now-one-two-three,&#8221; encouraged someone
on shore.</p>

<p>Sweet Caporal, holding his oar about two feet from
its end so as to lose all its leverage, pulled furiously,
the blade only catching the water occasionally, Jim
Mattenburg, with no oar-lock at all, improvised one
hand into a lock and hauled frantically with the other
one, while Jakie Mattenburg bailed the boat, which
was now pretty loggy with its weight of water.</p>

<p>&#8220;Talk about your Yale Crew!&#8221; called one
of the watchers.</p>

<p>&#8220;The new marine merry-go-round!&#8221; shouted
another.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now-one-two&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>The sharp crack of a rifle was heard from the woods
on the opposite shore from the picnickers; one of
the Mattenburg boys was conscious of a quick, short
whizzing sound, and then Charlie, the youngest of the
O&#8217;Connor boys, who was standing close to the
shore, slapped his right hand quickly to his left
arm, looked about bewildered, then turned suddenly
pale and staggered into the arms of one of the picnic
party.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look&#8212;&#173;look,&#8221; he said, releasing
his hand and affrightedly pointing to a little trickle
of blood on his arm. &#8220;I&#8217;m&#8212;&#173;I&#8217;m
shot&#8212;&#173;look&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>


<br><br>
<h1><a name="#16">Chapter XVI</a></h1>

<h2>Connover Breaks Loose</h2>

<p>Advancing stealthily, our young hero raised his rifle
and leveled it at the chief of the howling Zulus,
who clustered threateningly on the farther shore.
The young girl whom they had kidnapped lay bound hand
and foot, and Dan Dreadnought clenched his teeth with
anger as he heard her cries for help. The poisoned
spears of the infuriated Zulus were flying all about
him, but they did not cower the brave lad. He was
resolved at any cost to rescue that girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a Boy Scout,&#8221; he called, &#8220;and
I can handle a hundred savages if need be.&#8221;
Then, uttering the cry of the Eureka Patrol, he dashed
into the dugout which lay drawn up on the shore, and
using the butt end of his rifle for a paddle, he guided
his unsteady boat across the raging torrent amid a
fusillade of spears and arrows with which the frantic
Zulus vainly sought to stay his approach.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Lieutenant of the Eureka Patrol!&#8221;
called Dan. &#8220;Untie those fetters, or every one
of you shall die!&#8221;</p>

<p>His trusty companion, Ralph Redgore, tried to hold
him back, but all in vain.</p>

<p>Connover Bennett laid down the copy of <i>The Eureka
Patrol in South Africa</i>, by Captain Dauntless,
U. S. A., and dragging himself from the hammock, entered
the house. He was breathing hard as if he had been
running.</p>

<p>The bungalow was deserted save for the maid in the
kitchen, and Connover was monarch of all he surveyed.</p>

<p>Quietly, he crept upstairs and into the &#8220;den.&#8221;
In the corner among his father&#8217;s fishing-rods
and golf sticks stood a rifle. It was forbidden to
Connover, but unfortunately <i>The Eureka Patrol
in South Africa</i> dealt not with scout honor
and made no mention of the Seventh Law, which stipulates
that a &#8220;scout shall be obedient.&#8221; Nor had
Captain Dauntless thought it worth while to mention
Law One, which says that a &#8220;scout&#8217;s honor
is to be trusted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Connover glanced up and down the road from the bay-window
to see if by any chance his mother might have forgotten
something and was coming back. Reassured in this particular,
he took up the rifle and, standing before the large
pier-glass, he adopted a heroic attitude of aiming.
Then he looked from the window down into the woods
through which he could see little glints of the river.</p>

<p>It was not glints of Salmon River that he saw, but
the &#8220;Deadly Morass River&#8221; of South Africa;
the woods were not quiet, fragrant pine woods where
the First Bridgeboro Troop of real scouts was encamped,
but the deadly morass itself; and he was not Connover
Bennett, but <i>Dan Dreadnought</i>, and this
was the trusty rifle with which he would&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>He looked again from the bay-window to make sure that
his mother was not in sight. Then the creaking of
a door startled him and he laid the rifle down. It
was queer how every little sound startled him. He
unfastened his negligee shirt at the neck and, standing
before the pier-glass, arranged it as much like the
frontispiece pictures of <i>Dan Dreadnought</i>
as possible. There was a curious fluttering feeling
in his chest all the while which annoyed him. It did
not seem to jibe at all with the heroic program.</p>

<p>Yes, this was the rifle with which he would...</p>

<p>He tiptoed to the stairs and listened, &#8220;Molly,
is that you?&#8221; he called.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Master Connover.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, I just wanted to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went back into the room and opening the drawer
of the desk, took out a box of cartridges, extracted
several and put them in his pocket. When he replaced
the box he forgot which end of the drawer he had taken
it from and was in a quandary where to place it. He
took up the rifle again, then laid it down and the
thud of its butt on the floor startled him. What a
lot of noise it seemed to make!</p>

<p>It was oily and his hands were oily from it and left
an oily stain on the felt covering of the desk. He
placed the inkstand over it, and all the while he
felt very strange and nervous; trembling almost as
he planned his exploit.</p>

<p>Then he took the rifle and got behind the revolving-chair,
and rested the weapon on it. It was not a very realistic
jungle, but...</p>

<p>He saw the Zulus just as plain as day; and he saw
himself, or rather, <i>Dan Dreadnought</i>, in
that big pier-glass.</p>

<p>He knew the gun was not loaded and he pulled the trigger,
which clicked.</p>

<p>The click seemed louder than he thought it would and
he listened in suspense. No sound.</p>

<p>Yes, this was the rifle with which he would... Casting
one more cautious look from the window, he shouldered
the weapon and hurried quietly down the stairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;What time did my mother say she&#8217;d be
back?&#8221; he called.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not till dinnertime, Master Connover.&#8221;
He crossed the road, and headed through the woods
toward the river. Once in the woods, the spirit of
freedom took possession of him and he indulged in the
luxury of shooting the gun at nothing at all.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I am a scout,&#8217;&#8221; he said,
&#8220;&#8216;and can handle a hundred savages!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Whereas, in plain fact, he couldn&#8217;t have been
much farther from being a scout.</p>

<p>Arrested by a flutter in one of the trees, he leveled
his gun again and by the luck of a random shot, brought
down a robin. The sight of its quivering body and
loose-hanging neck as it lay at his feet almost frightened
him for he had never killed a red-blooded creature
before, and he felt now a sense of heavy guilt. He
was afraid to pick the robin up and when he finally
did so and saw how wilted and drooping the thing was
and how aimlessly the head swung he was seized with
a little panic of fear and dropped it suddenly.</p>

<p>But it was absolutely necessary that he should carry
out his program of encountering the Zulu&#8217;s.
As long as he was not really going to kill anyone
it was all right. He was at least going to have the
thrill of that experience. Now that he had killed
the robin, he found that in actual practice he preferred
a sort of modified Dan Dreadnought to the real one;
and he could piece out with his imagination the more
harrowing features of Captain Dauntless&#8217;s book.</p>

<p>So he pictured a dugout drawn up on the shore of the
river which he was approaching; and he pictured a
group of howling Zulus on the farther shore. He heard
ikes and the splashing of water, and it fitted well
with his heroic scheme to imagine these sounds were
made by the howling Zulus, though in reality he knew,
or thought he knew, that they came from farther
up the river near the scouts&#8217; camp.</p>

<p>He was within a few yards of the river now and pushing
through the thick growth which bordered it.</p>

<p>His imagination was working like machinery, and had
all the features and details of his daring act, pat.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I am a boy scout,&#8217;&#8221; he repeated,
&#8220;&#8216;and can handle&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>He raised his rifle and, aiming with dramatic gesture
at nothing in particular, pulled the trigger, then
dashed forward in a perfect frenzy of adventurous
delight to the shore.</p>

<p>On the other side of the river the O&#8217;Connor
boy was leaning back in the arms of one of a group
of people, the boys in the boat were mending their
efforts to get to shore; someone said, &#8220;There
he is!&#8221; and then all eyes were upon him and
Connover Bennett dropped the gun, reeled against a
tree and stood staring as he realized that he was nearer
to being the real <i>Dan Dreadnought</i> than
he had dreamed.</p>

<p>A cold sweat broke out upon his brow, his first impulse
was to run with all his might and main; but he could
not stir.</p>

<h1><a name="#17">Chapter XVII</a></h1>

<h2>The Real Thing</h2>

<p>It happened that same afternoon that Tom and Roy went
up to Salmon River Village to purchase some provisions
for camp. The two boys were on their way back from
the village and were discussing an interesting discovery
which they had made while there. This was a wireless
apparatus which the storekeeper had shown them with
great pride for he was one of that numerous class
of wireless amateurs whose a&#0137;rials may be seen stretching
from tree-tops to house-tops these days, and since
it was his pleasure to sit into the wee hours of the
morning with his head receivers on, eavesdropping
on the whole world, the two scouts had agreed to exchange
messages with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every man you meet seems to take some interest
in the scouts,&#8221; said Tom, in allusion to the
cordial storekeeper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, even Mr. Temple&#8217;s got a light case
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Not much</i>!&#8221; said Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes he has; he&#8217;s got what Doc Carson
calls a passive case. Doesn&#8217;t it beat all how
Doc gets onto this medical talk? Did you hear that
one he sprang the other night about a &#8216;superficial
abrasion&#8217;? Cracky, it nearly knocked me over!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And &#8216;septic,&#8217; too,&#8221; said
Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, &#8216;septic&#8217;s&#8217; his star
word now. Mr. Temple&#8217;s case is likely to become
acute any time,&#8221; Roy added as he jogged along,
jumping from one subject to another according to his
fashion. &#8220;You know you can have a thing and
not know it. Then something happens, you get a bad
cold, for instance, and that brings the whole thing
out. That&#8217;s the way it is with Mr. Temple&#8212;&#173;he&#8217;s
just beginning to get the bug; he doesn&#8217;t know
it yet. You ought to have heard him buzz me about
tracking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he wanted to know how I knew one golf
stick was hickory and another one maple. &#8216;Scout,&#8217;
said I. Oh, I&#8217;ve got <i>him</i> started-wait
till he picks up a little momentum and you&#8217;ll
see things fly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll never land <i>him</i>,&#8221;
said Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;I landed you, didn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I bet I land him before the Chief lands Mrs.
Bennett.&#8221;</p>

<p>They walked along a little while in silence. &#8220;What-what-did
Mary say?&#8221; Tom asked. He had asked the question
half a dozen times before, but it pleased him to imagine
that he had forgotten the answer. Roy understood.</p>

<p>&#8220;She wanted to know why you didn&#8217;t bring
the pin yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;d you tell her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I told her you were too busy to bother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&#8212;&#173;honest&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told her you had no time for girls. She said
it was just lovely. I don&#8217;t know whether she
meant you or the pin. She said the tracking was miraculous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She don&#8217;t know who&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, her father&#8217;s not going to tell her.
I&#8217;ve got him cinched. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised
if I was cashier in his bank in another six months-but
don&#8217;t mention it at camp fire, will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom laughed. &#8220;What did she say?&#8221; he repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you&#8217;s teen-eleven times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I forget.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to have gone yourself, anyway,&#8221;
said Roy, &#8220;then you&#8217;d have heard what
she said.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pretended not to have any sympathy with Tom in
this matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was that other thing she said?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that shouting?&#8221; said Roy.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was that other thing she said?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What other thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess that picnic bunch is flopping around
on the river from the sound.&#8221;</p>

<p>Silence for a few minutes.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was that other thing she said?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said Roy, &#8220;let&#8217;s
see&#8212;&#173;I forget.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on&#8212;&#173;stop your fooling! What was
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you <i>have</i> to know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She said she was going to recip&#8212;&#173;Oh,
listen!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Re-what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Reciprocate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pay you back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t take a cent. I wouldn&#8217;t
take anything from her,&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;I&#8217;m
a sco&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now don&#8217;t spring that! You better wait
and see what she offers you first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you take anything for a service?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Depends on what it was,&#8221; said Roy cautiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> wouldn&#8217;t take anything
for a service.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t take anything from her.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he did just the same.</p>

<p>They had left the road and were jogging scout-pace
along the beaten path through the woods which led
down to the river. As they neared it, a confusion
of sounds and voices greeted their ears and when they
presently emerged upon the shore they found a scene
of pandemonium.</p>

<p>In mid-stream was their own boat, two-thirds full
of water, and clinging to it were Tom&#8217;s erstwhile
Bridgeboro friends and a frantic, shrieking creature
whose streaming hair was plastered over his face and
who was in a perfect panic of fright as every moment
the gunwale of the loggy boat gave with his weight
and lowered his head into the water.</p>

<p>On the farther shore one little group called futilely
to the hapless crew, bidding them cling to the gunwale
and hold still; sensible enough advice, except that
no advice is of any use to a person in peril of drowning.
The bedraggled creature in particular would have prevented
any such orderly and rational conduct by his terror-stricken
clutchings and cries of &#8220;Save me!&#8221; as
if he were the only one in trouble. Another little
group on the opposite shore was gathered about a figure
which Tom and Roy could not see.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you got a rope over there?&#8221; called
Roy, kicking off his sneakers.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, we haven&#8217;t&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Got a shawl or a blanket?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8212;&#173;what good&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get it quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They always have camels&#8217;-hair shawls,&#8221;
he said hastily to Tom. Then raising his voice, &#8220;Someone
drowned over there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, shot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Killed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shin up that tree and see if you can get camp
with your whistle,&#8221; he ordered to Tom, throwing
off his shirt the while. &#8220;Whistle &#8216;Help&#8217;
by Morse&#8212;&#173;if they don&#8217;t answer, try
semaphore with your shirt; if that don&#8217;t get
them you&#8217;ll have to hoof it. Get Doc, whatever
you do. Shut up, will you?"&#8217; he shouted to the
frantic boy who was making all the noise. &#8220;Keep
your mouth shut and you&#8217;ll be all right!&#8221;</p>

<p>All this took but a few seconds and presently the
shrieking boy in the water grasped frantically at
Roy.</p>

<p>That was all he knew. Something struck him, and when
he recovered from his daze he was lying on shore with
several persons about him.</p>

<p>The new <i>Dan Dreadnought</i> was a pitiable
figure. The boy whom he had shot sat near him, ashen
white, his arm bleeding despite all efforts to stay
the flow of blood, and he himself, his voice husky
from his futile shrieking, the red mark of Roy&#8217;s
prompt but necessary blow standing out in bold relief
on his white face, lay, half dead with fright and
shock, and watched those about him as though in a trance.
It was a sad and inglorious end to his adventurous
career!</p>

<p>It took Roy but a few minutes to tear a couple of
shawls and a blanket into strips and tying these together
he took an end in his mouth and swam out for the boat.
Tying it to the painter-ring, he called to the people
on shore to pull easily and, himself guiding and holding
up the loggy, half-submerged boat, as best he could,
it was finally hauled out of deep water and its hapless
crew helped ashore.</p>

<p>Just as Roy helped that redoubtable leader, Sweet
Caporal, to scramble up the abrupt shore, a welcome
shout came from a tree top across the river.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re coming!&#8221;</p>

<p>Roy did not know whether it had been done by Morse
whistling or by semaphore. Tom had done it, that was
enough, and while he scrambled down from the tree
and swam across the river Roy rearranged the clumsily
made tourniquet which the picnickers had placed about
the arm of the wounded boy, and tightened it with
the leverage of a stick which successfully stayed
the flow of blood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some wrinkle, hey?&#8221; he said, smiling
down into the white face of the boy. &#8220;You could
lift the earth by leverage if you only had some floor
for your lever; ever hear that?&#8221;</p>

<p>No, the O&#8217;Connor boy had never heard that, but
he looked up into the cheery, brown eyes of Roy, whom
he knew slightly, and smiled himself.</p>

<p>The real scout and the burlesque scout who lay near
by presented a striking contrast. All the mock heroics
of the <i>Eureka Patrol</i> of Captain Dauntless
seemed cheap enough now, even to the frightened Connover
as he languidly watched this quiet exhibition of efficiency.
Never had he admired <i>Dan Dreadnought</i> as
he now admired Roy Blakeley, this cheerful, clean-cut
fellow who knew what to do and just how to do it;
and the gang, with all their bravado gone, watched
him too, feeling strange after the first bath they
had had in many a day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know what I&#8217;m going to do with
you?&#8221; said Roy, as he leaned over the O&#8217;Connor
boy and bathed his face. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to
give you to Mr. Ellsworth for a birthday present;
our troop&#8217;s two years old next week.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not many minutes before the welcome sound of
voices was heard in the wood and presently a half-dozen
scouts appeared with a canvas stretcher. Mr. Ellsworth
was with them and by his side was Doc Carson, or &#8220;Highbrow
Doc,&#8221; with his neat little first-aid case. Doc
was one of the ancient and honorable Ravens who were
not unconscious of their dignity, and he had had the
first-aid bee from the start.</p>

<p>It took him but a moment to determine that no fatalities
were going to result from the affair, and that all
Connover needed was a little reassuring that he would
not be sent to jail.</p>

<p>While he was putting an antiseptic dressing on the
O&#8217;Connor boy&#8217;s arm (the bullet had gone
in and out again through the fleshy part), Roy and
Tom heard for the first time the circumstances of the
whole affair, as they were related to Mr. Ellsworth.</p>

<p>It seemed that upon the appearance of Connover with
his gun he had been forbidden to go away and had obeyed,
probably because he was too frightened and helpless
to have any will of his own. His pitiable lack of
command throughout the whole affair was not the least
significant thing in his day&#8217;s work, and showed
how far he was from the real scout trail.</p>

<p>The occupants of the boat, spurred by the emergency,
had managed to get the frightened Connover aboard
and it was in their clumsy progress across the river
that one of the gunwales of the already loggy boat
had gone under, shipping more water than the craft
could carry besides its living occupants.</p>

<p>The O&#8217;Connor boy needed only prompt and efficient
treatment and the only peril he was in was that of
blood-poisoning. Doc dressed his wound antiseptically
and though he was not unable to walk, they bore him
to camp on the stretcher, for his loss of blood had
weakened him and the shock had unnerved him.</p>

<p>Just as they started Connover broke down completely,
clinging pitifully to Mr. Ellsworth and refusing to
go home. His fear of arrest on the one hand and his
fear of his parents on the other, made him go to pieces
entirely now that the first excitement was over. His
behaviour formed a ludicrous anti-climax for all the
<i>Dan Dreadnought</i> bombast and bravado, and
if it was not borne in upon him then how harmful the
books were, he at least began to see how ridiculous
they were. Indeed, the redoubtable <i>Dan</i>
had begun to lose prestige with Connover the moment
he had shot that robin.</p>

<p>At the sight of this childish display, Mr. Ellsworth
shook his head ruefully and said to Roy, &#8220;We
got away with it in Tom&#8217;s case, but I&#8217;m
afraid Connie&#8217;s a pretty big contract. What do
you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll come across,&#8221; said Roy. &#8220;He
didn&#8217;t hurt Charlie O&#8217;Connor so very much,
but I&#8217;ll bet he&#8217;s killed <i>Dan Dreadnought</i>
all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Connie,&#8221; said the scoutmaster,
in a half-indulgent tone that was not altogether complimentary,
&#8220;you&#8217;d better come along with us to camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you&#8212;&#173;will you&#8212;&#173;see
my mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye-es&#8212;&#173;guess so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8212;&#173;he won&#8217;t die&#8212;&#173;will
he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After forty or fifty years he might,&#8221;
said the scoutmaster. &#8220;Here, walk along with
me, and tell me how you came to shoot that rifle.&#8221;</p>


<br><br>
<h1><a name="#18">Chapter XVIII</a></h1>

<h2>Mrs. Bennett Comes Across</h2>

<p>Connover told him the whole story. In his extremity
he felt drawn to Mr. Ellsworth though he showed it
in a more effeminate way than Tom had shown it, and
the readiness with which he made the scoutmaster a
refuge rather jarred upon Mr. Ellsworth. Tom, at least,
had never gone to pieces like this.</p>

<p>But the scout movement draws its recruits from every
direction, and Mr. Ellsworth was the ideal scoutmaster.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then you think you wouldn&#8217;t like
to kill Zulus, after all, hey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;N-no, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too bad we had to sacrifice an innocent robin
to find that out, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>The maid at the Bennett bungalow had one good scout
quality; she was observant and the fleeting glimpse
which she had of Master Connover departing with the
rifle was promptly communicated to Mrs. Bennett upon
her return.</p>

<p>At the appalling picture of her son trudging across
the road into the woods with a fire-arm over his shoulder,
the good lady all but collapsed. Her first thought
was, of course, that he would shoot himself, which
seemed likely enough, and her fear for his safety
entirely obliterated her amazement at his shameless
disobedience. It was the day of Mrs. Bennett&#8217;s
Waterloo.</p>

<p>Out she went, and even in her haste and excitement
she picked up the <i>Dan Dreadnought</i> volume
which sprawled on the veranda, and tossed it into
the swinging seat, then hurried across the road and
into the woods. The worst thing she had against Captain
Dauntless was that he littered her tidy porch.</p>

<p>She followed the same beaten path to the river which
Connover had followed and when she reached the bank
a few belated stragglers of the picnic party were
gathering up their belongings on the opposite side.
One of them came over for her in the boat and told
her briefly of what had happened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he alive or dead?&#8221; she demanded, hysterically.
&#8220;Tell me the worst!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her inquiry was for Connover, of course, and upon
being told that his only trouble was a case of utter
fright, she said, &#8220;Oh, my poor boy!&#8221;</p>

<p>She followed the trail to Camp Ellsworth, hurrying
along the beaten path which the scouts had made, until
glimpses of their homelike little settlement were
visible through the trees.</p>

<p>As she approached it she noticed, even in her anxiety,
wide bands of bright red high up on the tree-trunks
at intervals. She learned later that these were to
indicate the path as well as might be, for a distance
on either side of it so that no arrow or missile of
any sort should be shot across it. It was one of several
precautions to guard against the breaking of this
inviolable rule. The path was sacred territory.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennett was now within the outskirts of the camp
and could smell the savory odor of cooking. She passed
the tree where the Silver Foxes had spiked a piece
of birch-bark with S. F. chalked upon it to indicate
that the boys of that patrol were watching the industrious
activities of a certain squirrel which patronized
that particular tree. Another trunk bore a similar
card with R. on it, showing that the Ravens were spying
on the private affairs of an oriole which nested above.
Little that oriole knew that seven photographs of
him were pasted in the Troop Book.</p>

<p>At camp a Red Cross flag had been raised above Mr.
Ellsworth&#8217;s own tent and except for the quiet
comings and going of the scoutmaster himself and Doc
Carson, all was quiet here. Mrs. Bennett had expected
to find the camp a scene of commotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Good</i> evening, Mrs. Bennett,&#8221;
said the scoutmaster, in a tone of pleasant surprise.
The spider was in his web at last, but he concealed
his feeling of elation. &#8220;You are just in time
to grace the festive board. We&#8217;re going to have
corn wiggles; did you ever eat a corn wiggle, Mrs.
Bennett?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is my boy?&#8221; she demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down, won&#8217;t you? He&#8217;s over
there learning how to tell a mushroom from a toadstool&#8212;&#173;something
every boy ought to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And this other boy?&#8221; she added, glancing
inside the tent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine-doing fine. One of our boys hiked it to
town for a doctor, and I thought you were he when
the sentinel told me someone was coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You saw me coming?&#8221;</p>


<center>
<img alt="illus7.jpg (115K)" src="illus7.jpg" height="570" width="854">
<br />
Mrs. Bennet &#8220;Comes across&#8221;
</center>
<br><br />


<p>&#8220;No, we heard you long before we saw you. I
wish now that Connover&#8217;s sense of hearing were
a little more acute. Then he&#8217;d have been able
to distinguish the locality of a human voice. But
there&#8217;s no use crying over spilled milk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennett listened breathlessly while he repeated
the story of the afternoon&#8217;s occurrences. While
he was talking a scout approached, removed his hat,
saluted Mr. Ellsworth, and handed him a paper. It was
a memorandum of the temperature of the river water,
an amateur forecast of the weather for the next day,
and a &#8220;stunt&#8221; proposition for O. K. The
scoutmaster asked one or two questions and dismissed
the messenger. Mrs. Bennett was a little surprised
to notice that the questions seemed to bear with practical
sense and foresight upon the physical welfare of the
boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you give your approval to everything?&#8221;
she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No&#8212;&#173;not always,&#8221; he laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what then? You can&#8217;t <i>watch</i>
them <i>all</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear, no; I just give my veto and forget
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You take the temperature of the river?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and test it for impurities twice a week.
Doc attends to that. Come inside, Mrs. Bennett.&#8221;</p>

<p>She greeted the reclining O&#8217;Connor boy and smoothed
his forehead tenderly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have his parents been notified?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m going to town myself this evening,&#8221;
said Mr. Ellsworth. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell them. My
idea is to have him remain with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And who will care for him while you are gone?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Ellsworth laughed. &#8220;Oh, Doc will be glad
to get rid of me,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
be back tomorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bathed it with carbolic, did you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Doc tells me carbolic is a little out of
date. How about that, Doc?&#8221;</p>

<p>Doc assented and there was something so eloquently
suggestive of efficiency about Doc that, although
Mrs. Bennett sniffed audibly, she did not venture
to ask what antiseptic had been used. She had supposed
that antiseptics of all kinds would be quite unheard
of in a camp of boys, and here out in the woods she
was being told by a quiet, respectful young fellow
in a khaki suit that her favorite antiseptic was &#8220;out
of date.&#8221;</p>

<p>She received the blow with fortitude.</p>

<p>At a little distance from the tent several boys were
engaged in the preparation of supper and the setting
of the long board under the trees. Others were busy
with various forms of house-keeping, or rather camp-keeping,
and her domestic instinct prompted her to cast an
occasional shrewd look at the systematic and apparently
routine work which was going on. What she could not
help noticing was the general aspect of orderliness
which the camp displayed. Not a paper box nor a tin
can was to be seen. She had always associated camping
with a sort of rough-and-tumble life and with carelessness
in everything pertaining to one&#8217;s physical welfare.
Cleanliness was, to her notion, quite incompatible
with life in tents and cooking out of doors.</p>

<p>Her casual discovery of the practice of testing the
river water at stated intervals was in the nature
of a knock-out blow. She felt a little bewildered
as she watched the comings and goings of the troop
members. She did not altogether like the realization
that the water which had never been tested for her
own son&#8217;s bathing was regularly tested for this
&#8220;Wild West crew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s our bulletin-board. Let me show
you about the camp, Mrs. Bennett. You see, you are
not our only visitor; we have a delegation from Barrel
Alley, as well.&#8221;</p>

<p>A little way from the roaring fire, whence emanated
a most savory odor, the gallant representatives of
Bridgeboro&#8217;s East End were watching the preparations
for supper. They had proved faithless to the excursionists
and Mr. Ellsworth had invited them to dine at camp,
supplementing the invitation with an offer to pay
their way home by train, they having come gratuitously
on a &#8220;freight.&#8221; Mr. Ellsworth looked far
into the future, but just at that moment Mrs. Bennett
was his game.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, you see, is one of the patrol tents and
over here is the other. We&#8217;re hoping for still
a third. Here&#8217;s our wireless apparatus. The boys
have just discovered that Mr. Berry, the storekeeper
over in the village, has an outfit, so they&#8217;re
in high hopes of having a little chat with him. Here,
you see, are the drain ditches, so that the camp is
free from dampness and stagnant water. We&#8217;ll
be lowering the colors presently. Dorry, my boy, bring
the Troop Book over so Mrs. Bennett can see it&#8212;&#173;and
the Troop Album also. Ah, here&#8217;s Connie now.&#8221;</p>

<p>From among the group about the fire Connover came
guiltily forward. Mrs. Bennett put her arm about him
although she said nothing and seemed not altogether
pleased. The recollection of his disobedience was now
beginning to supplant her fear and anxiety. A little
group of scouts, all on the alert for service, and
anxious to advertise the details and features of their
camp life, accompanied the trio about.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are those?&#8221; Mrs. Bennett asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Spears,&#8221; said Roy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you throw them at animals?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed,&#8221; laughed another boy. &#8220;We
spear papers with them, like this.&#8221; He speared
a fallen leaf to show her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Camp is cleared every morning,&#8221; said
Mr. Ellsworth, &#8220;and here is our first aid outfit&#8212;&#173;our
special pride,&#8221; he added as they re-entered his
own little tent. &#8220;We have better facilities for
the care of an injured person than are to be had in
the village.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What were those signs I saw on the trees as
I came?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just stalking notes; we study and photograph
the wild life.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s pause. &#8220;It is certainly
nice to encourage a feeling of friendship for the
forest life,&#8221; she conceded.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not so much a feeling of friendship as
of kinship, Mrs. Bennett.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned about and looked sharply at one of the
scouts who stood near by. &#8220;You are not the Slade
boy?&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes-mam.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hardly knew you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennett&#8217;s housewifely instincts would not
permit her to give any sign of surrender until she
had proof of the cooking. But away down in her mother&#8217;s
heart was an uncomfortable feeling which she could
not overcome; a feeling of disappointment and dissatisfaction
with her own son. She had too much pride to show it,
but Connover felt in some vague way that she was not
well pleased. She was a mother of high ideals and
she was not undiscerning. Aside from her son&#8217;s
disobedience, which had been a shock to her, what
an inglorious afternoon had been his! It seemed that
every one about her had done something worthy that
afternoon except her own son. There lay his victim,
the O&#8217;Connor boy, bearing his suffering in silence.
She noticed that the boys seemed somehow to make allowance
for Connover, and it touched her pride.</p>

<p>While the last few touches for this special meal were
preparing, she and Mr. Ellsworth wandered a little
way out of camp. He spoke kindly, almost indulgently,
she thought, but as one who knew his business and
was qualified to speak. He had stormed Mrs. Bennett&#8217;s
fortress too many times to mince matters now.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that you&#8217;re really
to blame, Mrs. Bennett&#8212;&#173;except indirectly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8212;&#173;to blame?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I blame <i>Dan Dreadnought</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>never</i> approved of Captain Dauntless&#8217;
books,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It was a compromise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look up there, Mrs. Bennett&#8212;&#173;see
that nest? Would you believe it, the boys got a photograph
of the young birds in that nest and the old bird never
knew it.&#8221;</p>

<p>They walked along, he swinging a stick whick he had
broken from a tree. &#8220;There is no such man as
Captain Dauntless, you know. Captains in the army
have other work to do than to write stories for boys.
Captain Dauntless is a myth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is so hard to know what boys should read,&#8221;
she sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not as hard as it used to be. Remind
me to give you a paper before you go. You see, if
Connie had been a scout,&#8212;&#173;well now, let&#8217;s
begin at the beginning. If he had been a scout he wouldn&#8217;t
have read those books in the first place; they&#8217;re
really not books at all, they&#8217;re infernal machines.
Then if he had been a scout, of course, he wouldn&#8217;t
have disobeyed you; he wouldn&#8217;t have sneaked
off&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennett set her lips rather tight at that word,
but she did not contest the point.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he had been a scout he wouldn&#8217;t have
killed a robin&#8212;&#173;but if he <i>had</i>
killed a robin, it would have been by skill and not
by a silly, dangerous random shot&#8212;&#173;and he
wouldn&#8217;t have been afraid of the presence of
death or the sight of blood. If he had been a scout
he could have determined unerringly the locality of
sounds and human voices, and Charlie O&#8217;Connor
wouldn&#8217;t&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennett winced.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he had been a scout he would have known
how to swim; there isn&#8217;t a member of my troop
that can&#8217;t swim. And if he had been a scout he
wouldn&#8217;t have been afraid to go home. Connie
has the best home in the world, Mrs. Bennett&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have done everything for Connover&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you see, he was afraid to go to it&#8212;&#173;and
so he came here with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cheerful call of the bugle told that supper was
ready. Through the trees they could see the scouts
assembling until each stood at his place at the long
board under trees whose foliage had begun to dim in
the fading light.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pretty sight,&#8221; she said,
pausing and raising her lorgnette to her eyes. &#8220;What
are they all standing for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Till you have taken your seat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Smilingly she started toward them with all the cultured
affability of a true guest. She knew how to do this
thing, and she was quite at home now. Mr. Ellsworth
knew that her manner covered a sense of humiliation,
but she carried it off well and so together they came
out of the woods into the clearing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was saying that he came here and&#8212;&#173;and
we want him to stay here. Will you let him join us,
Mrs. Bennett?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would he have two blankets over him at night?&#8221;
she asked after a moment&#8217;s dismayed pause.</p>

<p>The question was not a surrender; it was a flag of
truce, meaning that she would discuss terms.</p>

<p>The surrender came after supper.</p>


<br><br>
<h1><a name="#19">Chapter XIX</a></h1>

<h2>First Aid by Wireless</h2>

<p>IT never rains but it pours, and the conversion of
Mrs. Bennett to scouting was shortly followed by the
greatest catch of the season.</p>

<p>Charlie O&#8217;Connor came into the troop on the
same wave which brought Connover, and East End contingent,
though it did not surrender as yet, retired to the
sweltering and almost deserted Bridgeboro, and tried
to kindle a fire in Temple&#8217;s lot after the Camp
Ellsworth fashion. The effort was not very successful.</p>

<p>The next day Jakie Mattenburg, on the strength of
talk he had overheard in camp, tried his hand, or
rather, his foot, at stalking, and was surprised to
find that it was rather more interesting to watch the
movements of a sparrow than to throw stones at it.</p>

<p>It could hardly be said that this band of seasoned
hoodlums made much immediate progress toward scouting,
but they remembered their rescue from the river at
Roy&#8217;s hands, and they accorded him thereafter
a grudging measure of consideration which, in the
fullness of time, blossomed into genuine friendship.
They were, in fact, the future Elk Patrol in its chrysalis
form; but their career as scouts is part of another
story.</p>

<p>A few days after the events of the preceding chapter
the troop&#8217;s birthday was celebrated in camp
and Connover and Charlie O&#8217;Connor submitted
themselves to Roy, who tied a pink ribbon about the
right arm of each. From Connover&#8217;s ribbon depended
a card reading,</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;<i>Chief<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With Many Happy Returns from<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Silver Foxes</i></p>

<p>while Charlie O&#8217;Connor was presented as the
gift of the Ravens.</p>

<p>The presentations were made at supper and the two
tenderfeet were led (with rather sheepish faces) to
Mr. Ellsworth at the head of the table and tendered
to him in true birthday fashion amid much laughter.</p>

<p>Roy made a characteristic speech. &#8220;These two
valuable gifts are presented to our beloved scoutmaster
with twelve profit-sharing coupons. When you get one
hundred of these coupons take them to Temple&#8217;s
lot in Bridgeboro and receive a new scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Honorable Charles O&#8217;Connor has always
had brothers enough, but now he has a few hundred
thousand more, so he ought to be satisfied. This priceless
gift&#8221; (grabbing Connover by his pink ribbon)
&#8220;was very difficult to procure; it is <i>what
you have always wanted</i>. If it doesn&#8217;t
fit you can exchange it. Honorable Bennover Connett
is the only survivor, ladies and gentlemen&#8212;&#173;the
<i>only survivor</i> of the extinct Eureka Patrol!
The Eureka Patrol was a part of the only original Cock
and Bull Troop of Nowhere-in-Particular. The records
of this troop, known as the <i>Dan Dreadnought Series</i>,
are donated to Camp Ellsworth for fuel in case the
kindling wood runs short. Full and implicit directions
go with each gift.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a gala occasion in camp and the troop sat late
about the roaring fire that night.</p>

<p>They were just raking up the last embers preparatory
to turning in when they were startled by the sound
of running footsteps, and out of the darkness emerged
a dark-cloaked figure with streaming hair and glints
of white under the heavy garment which she wore.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8212;&#173;lost the path,&#8221; she gasped,
&#8220;and&#8212;&#173;and then I saw your&#8212;&#173;light&#8212;&#173;and-oh,
Mr. Ellsworth&#8212;&#173;the house&#8212;&#173;was robbed
and James&#8212;&#173;is shot and-there&#8217;s another
man shot&#8212;&#173;and it was all planned for they&#8217;ve
cut the wires&#8212;&#173;and we have to get help&#8212;&#173;a
doctor&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Mary Temple who gasped this shocking news and
then all but collapsed from fear and haste and excitement.
An automobile coat had been donned over her nightdress.
For a few moments she was utterly unable to give a
coherent account of what had happened at Five Oaks.
The few minutes during which she had been lost in the
woods, together with the appalling events at home,
had quite unnerved her and she clung to Mr. Ellsworth,
looking affrightedly about her as if she were being
pursued.</p>

<p>He did not wait to get at the details. Something had
happened and medical aid was needed. That was apparent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did they send you?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No&#8212;&#173;I just came&#8212;&#173;I know
scouts can do anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said concurrently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, we can&#8217;t get a real doctor,
but&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can try,&#8221; said a voice.</p>

<p>She looked up startled, and in the last dying glow
of the fire she saw the stolid face of Tom Slade.
It was the first time she had seen him since her mother&#8217;s
mishap and their visit at camp, though she knew from
Roy of his tracking feat and recovery of her pin. She
knew too of his night in the lock-up, but no knowledge
of his father&#8217;s connection with the affair had
come to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I meant&#8212;&#173;I was coming to thank you&#8212;&#173;Tom;
truly, I was&#8212;&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>But Tom had turned away and presently she saw an agile
figure spring after him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to try for it, Tom?&#8221; said
Roy. &#8220;It&#8217;s after one o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He sometimes stays there till two&#8212;&#173;he
told me&#8212;&#173;he&#8217;ll be there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I want him to be.&#8221; &#8220;Mary
thinks you snubbed her, Tom; why didn&#8217;t you
speak to her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I had her ball to toss back,&#8221;
said Tom.</p>

<p>It was odd that he should think of that now.</p>

<p>In the lean-to Roy lit the lantern and presently the
whole troop was divided into two groups; one was getting
ready the stretcher and helping Doc Carson, and the
other stood about the lean-to watching Tom, who sat
on the rickety grocery box before the wireless apparatus.
Roy stood anxiously at his shoulder; the others waited,
speaking to each other in an undertone occasionally,
but never to Tom. By common consent they seemed to
leave this thing for him to do, and there was about
him a certain detachment from the others which suggested
slightly his manner that day when he had been arrested.</p>

<p>Boys came and went, Mr. Ellsworth and others departed
hastily with Doc, the little group in the lean-to
watched and waited while Tom, apparently unconscious
of all about him, sat there adjusting his spark gap.
Occasionally he spoke in an undertone to Roy, but seemed
oblivious of all else.</p>

<p>&#8220;R. V., isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Roy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better look and make sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roy consulted a note book. &#8220;R. V. is right,&#8221;
said he.</p>

<p>Tom laid his hand upon the key and adjusted his head
receivers. Then up into the darkness and out into
the vast trackless sky went the call for R. V.</p>

<p>It was then the boys noticed the cloaked figure of
the girl standing in the background watching. &#8220;I
thought you went with Doc and Mr. Ellsworth,&#8221;
someone said.</p>

<p>&#8220;He said I might stay,&#8221; she answered timidly.</p>

<p>Tom glanced around and saw her, but showed no interest.
Roy sat on the edge of the instrument table, anxiously
waiting.</p>

<p>&#8220;They can&#8217;t cut this kind of wires,&#8221;
he said cheerily to Mary as if to make up for Tom&#8217;s
silence.</p>

<p>Eagerly she watched Tom. She seemed fascinated with
his absorption and with every slight move of his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing doing?&#8221; said Roy with a note
of discouragement.</p>

<p>Tom made no answer, only adjusted the sending instrument
to a different wave-length.</p>

<p>&#8220;Too late, Tommy boy,&#8221; Roy said.</p>

<p>Tom paid no attention, only in dogged silence adjusted
the sending instrument to another wavelength and readjusted
the tuning-coil.</p>

<br />
After sending the wireless message, Tom finds himself a hero.
</center>
<br><br />


<p>Mary watched him anxiously. She too seemed all by
herself&#8212;&#173;a strange, wide-eyed figure, standing
apart with the great auto cloak about her, silently
watching and not daring to ask a question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who did you say was hurt?&#8221; Tom asked
at length, without turning.</p>

<p>&#8220;A burglar and James&#8212;&#173;our chauffeur,
you know&#8212;&#173;they were both shot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you got him?&#8221; asked Roy excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nope.&#8221;</p>

<p>He adjusted the tuning coil again and waited patiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Too late, Tom.&#8221;</p>

<p>No answer. Then suddenly Tom&#8217;s hand flew to
the sending key, and as the letters of the Morse Code
clicked away into the night a slight smile crept over
his face. There was no member of the troop who could
use the Morse alphabet with such rapidity as Tom,
and he often thought (but seldom spoke) of that first
message he and Roy had flashed together from the little
tower on Blakeley&#8217;s Hill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Up?&#8221; asked Roy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure he&#8217;s up; wait till I get his O.
K.&#8221;</p>

<p>Back through the night and down to this boy at the
rough table and to the tense little group of watchers
came the &#8220;O. K.&#8221; which assured them that
the message was understood.</p>

<p>Tom rose and Mary Temple impulsively made a step toward
him, then paused half-embarrassed.</p>

<p>She actually stood a little in awe of Tom Slade, of
Barrel Alley, who had cheated her and stolen her ball.
And Tom Slade, Scout, who was sure of himself and
afraid of nothing, was very much in awe of this young
girl. And Roy Blakeley, his chum, understood and took
the timid, admiring girl into his own charge and so
the little party made its way out of the dark woods
and across the bridge to Five Oaks.</p>

<p>Mary Temple felt very much as Tom had felt the day
after his own first essay at signalling. She knew
it was a wireless apparatus he had used (she would
have asked questions of him if she had dared), and
she supposed that he was calling a doctor. She had
experienced a thrill of admiration at the quiet, stolid
exhibition of skill, and his apparent aloofness had
only deepened her admiration into awe. But as Tom himself
had felt so long ago, she wanted to see the tangible
result of this work which was such a mystery to her.</p>

<p>Tom hurried stolidly along with Pee-wee and Charlie
O&#8217;Connor, with that clumsy gait which he had
never entirely overcome, and which, ever so faintly,
suggested the old shuffle. Whether there was any foreboding
in his mind none of his companions knew for he was
never talkative, but in the light of what soon happened,
it occurred to them afterward that he had known all
along what was before him, that he knew what he should
see at Five Oaks, and that, like the good scout, he
was <i>prepared</i>.</p>

<p>On the way Roy gleaned from Mary more of what had
taken place. It appeared that Mr. Temple, hearing
sounds in the rooms below, had rung for the gardener
who, with the chauffeur, had come from the garage and
entered a back door, letting themselves in by means
of the chauffeur&#8217;s key. They were just passing
through the foyer when three masked men rushed out
of the breakfast room. One got away carrying some loot,
not, however, before he had shot and seriously wounded
James, the chauffeur, who had dropped in the hall
with a bullet in his thigh.</p>

<p>Neither of Mr. Temple&#8217;s men recalled what became
of the second man more than that he disappeared, they
thought, empty-handed. The third had made for an open
window and was just climbing out when the gardener
shot him and he fell to the ground outside, where he
still lay when the scouts arrived.</p>

<p>The gardener insisted that the man had drawn a revolver,
but no revolver could be found about him.</p>

<p>It was then discovered that the burglary was a well-planned
affair, for the telephone wires had been severed,
and it was upon discovery of this fact that Mary had
hurried to Camp Ellsworth.</p>

<p>Doc Carson was busy with James, who had been lifted
to a couch in the hall, when Mary saw the tangible
result of Tom&#8217;s message in the form of two dazzling
acetylene headlights coming under the <i>porte coch&#232;re</i>,
and the doctor stepping briskly into the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Tom,&#8221; she exclaimed, with as much
delight as the occasion would permit, and with gratitude
in every note of her voice. &#8220;He came, just as
you&#8212;&#8212;&#173;Oh, where is he?&#8221; she
broke off suddenly, as she noticed that Tom was not
there.</p>

<p>It was then and not until then that a quick thought
flashed upon Roy and he hurried out and around the
house.</p>

<p>There, under the bay-window, lay a motionless form.
Tom was bending over it and Roy could hear his quick,
short breaths as he tried to control his emotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he dead, Tom?&#8221; Roy asked softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s&#8212;&#173;it&#8217;s my father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know. Is he dead?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get the doctor&#8212;&#173;I&#8217;m glad it
was me sent the message for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was another culmination of another triumph.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad too, Tom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll have to see him&#8212;&#173;they&#8217;ll
have to know now. You tell the doctor. I got to be
loyal. Tell Mr.&#8212;&#173;Mr. Ellsworth he&#8217;s
got to remember what he said, that there wasn&#8217;t
no First Bridgeboro Troop when he was a boy&#8212;&#173;you
heard him say that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He <i>will</i> remember it, Tom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get the doctor&#8212;&#173;quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom bent lower over the motionless form of his father
as if he were asking a question.</p>


<br><br>
<h1><a name="#20">Chapter XX</a></h1>

<h2>Tom Tosses it Back</h2>

<p>When they brought the doctor around they found him
still in that position and had to lift him gently
away. The announcement that the wound was not fatal
did not seem to move his stolidness in the least.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to see Mr. Temple,&#8221; he said doggedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Tom?&#8221; said Mr. Ellsworth
putting his arm over the boy&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to see him before he has him arrested&#8212;&#173;then
if the wires are cut I&#8217;ll send a wireless for
the constable&#8212;&#173;only I want to see Mr. Temple
first. I&#8217;m not afraid of him now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He couldn&#8217;t be arrested to-night, Tom,
he&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to see Mr. Temple&#8212;&#173;<i>you</i>
tell him,&#8221; he added, turning suddenly upon Mary,
almost with an air of command. &#8220;I did something
for <i>you</i>&#8212;&#173;once.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl was sobbing and seemed to hesitate as if
not knowing whether to say something to Tom or to
do his bidding. &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll get him,&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p>It was not the scout fashion to order a young girl
upon an errand, and it was certainly not the scout
fashion, nor anyone else&#8217;s fashion to summon
John Temple thus peremptorily. But Tom was a sort of
law unto himself and even Mr. Ellsworth did not interfere.</p>

<p>The master of Five Oaks came around the house with
his daughter clinging to him. And Tom Slade, who had
knocked his hat off, stood up and faced him. It was
not always easy to get Tom&#8217;s meaning; he often
used pronouns instead of names and his dogged, stolid
temperament showed in his phraseology.</p>

<p>&#8220;He told me when I joined the troop that I had
to be loyal, and that&#8217;s the reason I&#8217;m
doing it and not because I believe in being a burglar.&#8221;
The na&#239;veness of this announcement might have seemed
ludicrous if Tom&#8217;s voice had not trembled with
earnestness. &#8220;And he said there wasn&#8217;t
no scouts when he was a boy&#8212;&#173;that&#8217;s
my father there. And that&#8217;s what <i>you</i>
got to remember too. I tracked him before and I got
the pin and gave him my five dollars that I&#8217;d
saved.&#8221;</p>

<p>Someone tittered: John Temple frowned and shook his
head impatiently and there was no more tittering.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you know about that, and that I didn&#8217;t
bring it to her &#8217;cause I was scared, and I couldn&#8217;t
help him coming here to-night. Only you got to remember
there wasn&#8217;t any troop when he was a boy&#8212;&#173;you
got to remember that. I&#8217;d &#8216;a&#8217; been
a burglar myself, that&#8217;s sure, only for him&#8221;
(indicating Mr. Ellsworth) &#8220;and the troop&#8212;&#173;and
Roy. And he&#8217;s sick&#8212;&#173; that&#8217;s
most what&#8217;s the matter with him and I&#8217;d
like to have him brought to our camp and have Doc
take care of him till he gets well enough so&#8217;s
Mr. Ellsworth can talk to him, &#8217;cause Mr. Ellsworth,
he never fails&#8212;&#173;he&#8217;s never failed
once. But if you won&#8217;t do that&#8212;&#173;if
you won&#8217;t leave him&#8212;&#173;let him&#8212;&#173;go
like that&#8212;&#173;then you got to remember that
there wasn&#8217;t any troop when he was a boy-&#8217;cause
I&#8217;m rememberin&#8217; it&#8212;&#173; and------&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He <i>will</i> remember it,&#8221; said
Mary, weeping. &#8220;Oh, he does remember it, Tom,
he does.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Temple drew her to him. &#8220;Go on, my boy,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m listening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you want me to send a wireless for the constable,
I&#8217;ll do it, &#8217;cause I got to do a service&#8212;&#173;only
you got to remember&#8212;&#173;that&#8217;s only fair.
And I got something else to say while I&#8217;m not
scared of you-&#8217;tain&#8217;t because I got any
reason to be scared of you either&#8212;&#173;but I&#8217;m
sorry I threw that stone at you. That was what started
<i>him</i> for the bad&#8212;&#173;when he went
away and left me&#8212;&#173;but it started me for the
good anyhow&#8212;&#173;so that&#8217;s something.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment no one spoke. Mr. Ellsworth would not
spoil the effect of Tom&#8217;s words by uttering
so much as a single word himself. It was John Temple
who broke the silence, quieting his daughter who seemed
about to break forth again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will do more than remember,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Come here, my boy. There will be no charge
made against your father, so there will be no need
of a service unless it is a service of my own. It
has been borne in upon me lately that your good scoutmaster
is a wonder-worker, and what you have just said strengthens
that growing conviction. I have been thinking, too,
how I might further the movement so well represented
by him, and the story of your experience with your
father has quite decided me. For every one of those
five precious dollars that you were sensible enough
to save and noble enough to give away, there shall
be given a thousand to the cause whose precepts and
principles you represent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let this poor man be taken to your camp in
the woods if you like, and let your doctor take care
of him, and see that he does his duty. I will visit
your camp myself to-morrow if I may.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Ellsworth assured him that he might, and as for
Doc, a half dozen chimed forth that he was the only
ever, <i>etc</i>., <i>etc</i>.</p>

<p>Tom said nothing. He had never been much of a scout
missionary, and the unexpected and altogether amazing
conversion of John Temple quite overwhelmed him. He
did not realize that he himself had done it, in his
own stolid, crude way.</p>

<p>But would his hope be borne out? Would the Wizard
Ellsworth indeed &#8220;get away with it,&#8221; and
make a new man of poor, wretched Bill Slade? I should
hesitate to affirm it; but I wouldn&#8217;t dare to
deny it&#8212;&#173;not before the boys. So let us
rest in the hope born of Tom&#8217;s own words that
Mr. Ellsworth had never yet failed. Let us believe
that the woods and the camp-fire yarns and the company
of these boys may be a helping hand to the broken
wretch who had no First Bridgeboro Troop to look to
when he was a boy.</p>

<p>As they bore the stretcher over the bridge toward
the woods beyond, Tom heard the sound of footfalls
a little distance behind them, and paused.</p>

<p>It proved to be Mary Temple.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom, is that you?&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes-it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to thank you, Tom. I was coming to your
camp to-morrow, but I couldn&#8217;t wait. I-want
to thank you, Tom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, for everything. You don&#8217;t realize
the things you do and that&#8217;s the best part of
it.&#8221; &#8220;I didn&#8217;t do noth&#8212;&#173;anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You got me back my pin. Oh, Tom, you don&#8217;t
suppose five thousand dollars is all my father will
give&#8212;&#173;he&#8217;ll give ten times that!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom said nothing, and for a moment they stood there
near the bridge, hearing the river rippling below.</p>

<p>Then, impulsively, she leaned forward and kissed him.
&#8220;There,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that&#8217;s
how much I thank you! And I&#8217;m coming to your
camp again. I&#8217;m coming with my father,&#8221;
she said, as she turned and ran toward home.</p>

<p>Still Tom said nothing. He could not handle a situation
like this at all.</p>

<p>A little way down the road she turned and waved her
hand, and he realized that if he were going to make
any acknowledgment it would have to be done now. So
he mastered his embarrassment as best he could, raised
his hand awkwardly to his lips and threw a kiss to
Mary Temple!</p>

<p>He had scarcely turned and started after the little
cavalcade when he stumbled into Roy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was just coming to see where you were. &#8220;Well,
you took it, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221; Roy added, as
they walked along together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Took what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Something for a service.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8212;&#173;I couldn&#8217;t help myself,&#8221;
said Tom.</p>

<p>For answer Roy gave him a shove and laughed outright.
&#8220;So your Uncle Dudley was right and you broke
the scout law after all&#8212;&#173;ya-a-ah-a!&#8221;</p>

<p>They walked a little way in silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, anyway,&#8221; Roy said, &#8220;you can
say you tossed it back, can&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twasn&#8217;t her ball.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was much better than a ball.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know what I took and what I tossed
back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A scout is observant,&#8221; said Roy.</p>

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment

Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
