description: Tom is a sixteen-year-old street tough, left to fend for himself by his
  worthless father, Bill Slade, after wealthy landowner John Temple evicts them. Tom
  scorns the Boy Scout movement, as does Temple and his effeminate son Wilfred. Because
  of his interest in Temple's daughter Mary, Tom gets a job and joins the Scouts after
  seeing that they are as strong and tough as he. On a camping trip, Tom sees his
  father and a gang of tramps attempt to rob Temple's home. The Scouts frightened
  them, and when they attempt another robbery, Slade is slightly wounded and Temple's
  servant is shot. Although the Scouts use a wireless to summon medical help, Temple
  remains steadfast in his oposition to them. After he and Wilfred get lost on a fishing
  trip, Mrs. Temple asks the Scouts to search for them. Temple meets Slade, and they
  fight until they both fall unconscious. After the Scouts rescue them, Temple relents
  in his opposition, Wilfred joins, and Slate decides to get a job.
